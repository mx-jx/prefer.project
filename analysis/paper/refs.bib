Reporting on their most recent previous inpatient detoxification, 27\% had relapsed the day they were discharged, 65\% within a month of discharge, and 90\% within a year of discharge. 63\% reported they wanted medication-assisted treatment (MAT) after discharge from the current admission. The odds of desiring a treatment medication increased by a factor of 1.02 for every 1\% increase in perceived relapse risk (p{$<$}.01).

The current study is a cross-sectional survey of patients (N=69) enrolled in buprenorphine maintenance therapy (BMT). We examined patient demographics, BMT characteristics (e.g., dose, time in BMT), and patient perspectives regarding intended duration of BMT. In addition, patients’ reasons for continuing or discontinuing BMT were investigated. Results revealed that the majority (82\%) of participants reported wanting to continue BMT for at least 12months. Age at first drug use, time in BMT, concern about pain, and concern about relapse were all positively associated with intended duration of BMT. The following were negatively associated with intended duration of BMT: recent discussion with a treatment provider about BMT discontinuation, prior attempt to discontinue BMT, concern about withdrawal symptoms, experiencing pleasurable effects from taking buprenorphine, and perceived conflicts of BMT with life, work, or school obligations. The most common reasons for wanting to continue BMT included concerns about withdrawal symptoms, relapse, and pain. Although preliminary, the findings highlight key issues with regard to patients’ perspectives of BMT. The results of this study provide information that may be useful in improving OMT programs and treatment outcomes.},

  abstract = {Background: Vancouver is an international leader in implementing interventions to reduce harms related to drug use. However, street-involved young people who use drugs continue to be vulnerable to overdose death, hepatitis C (HCV) infection, and high rates of syringe sharing. To better understand this in the context of the intensive public health response, we examined how young people, who are involved in the ‘street drug scene’, understood, experienced and engaged with harm reduction. Methods: Twelve semi-structured interviews were conducted in 2013 with 13 young people (ages 17–28) recruited from the At-Risk Youth Study, a prospective cohort of street-involved and drug-using young people. These interviews were embedded within a larger, eight-year program of ethnographic research and explored participants’ understandings of harm reduction, their use of specific services, and their ideas about improving their day-to-day lives. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and a thematic analysis was performed. Results: Young peoples’ ideas about harm reduction were diverse and expansive. They articulated the limitations of existing programs, indicating that while they are positioned to reduce the risk of HIV and HCV transmission, they offer little meaningful support to improve young peoples’ broader life chances. Young people described strategies to mitigate risk and harm in their own lives, including transitioning to drugs deemed less harmful and attempting to gain access to drug treatment. Finally, young people indicated that spatial considerations (e.g., distance from Vancouver's Downtown Eastside) strongly determined access to services. Conclusions: In Vancouver, a large, well established harm reduction infrastructure seeks to reduce HIV and HCV transmission among street-involved young people. However, young peoples’ multiple understandings, experiences and engagements with harm reduction in this setting illustrate the limitations of the existing infrastructure in improving their broader life chances.},

  abstract = {Background Opioids and stimulants are the most commonly injected illicit drugs worldwide and in Australia. While some people who inject drugs (PWID) prefer either opioids or stimulants, others regularly use both opioids and stimulants. Limited available research indicates that those who use opioids and stimulants together, either in combination or alternating between the two, may engage in injection-related practices which potentially place them at greater health risk and could lead to poorer health outcomes. Methods Participants were recruited nationally through member organizations of the Australian Injecting and Illicit Drug Users League (AIVL); these organizations represent PWID in each Australian state and territory. This study compared a sample of PWID (N~=~535) who reported past-month injection of opioids only (N~=~173), stimulants only (N~=~208), or both (N~=~154) on a range of health and wellbeing outcomes. PWID completed a survey assessing drugs injected, frequency of injecting, receptive equipment sharing, psychological distress, self-reported hepatitis C (HCV) status, experienced and internalized stigma, drug use salience, and community attachment. Results People who injected both opioids and stimulants reported more frequent injecting, more experiences of stigma, and greater reported HCV diagnosis than people who injected stimulants or opioids alone. They also showed greater attachment to a community of PWID and greater salience of drug use to their identity. Conclusions The findings of increased injecting and broader harms associated with injecting both stimulants and opioids are important for tailoring harm reduction and intervention designs for people who use both opioid and stimulant drugs, including prioritizing peer-based approaches.},

  abstract = {Background Ensuring young people experience good sexual health is a key public health concern. Yet, some vulnerable groups of young people are at higher risk of poor sexual health, and consequently require additional support to achieve good sexual health. Therefore, the aim of this systematic review was to identify and assess the evidence base for behavioural and psychosocial interventions to improve sexual health for young people with additional vulnerabilities. Methods We searched for randomised controlled trials of interventions aimed at promoting sexual health, with any non-pharmacological comparator (e.g., waitlist control). Key outcomes of interest were indicators of sexual health (e.g., condom use, attitudes to contraception, knowledge of risk). Participants in eligible trials were under 25 years old and in a high-risk group (alcohol and other drug use; justiceinvolved; homeless; LGBTQI+; mental ill-health; ethnic minority, or out-of-home care). The final literature searches were performed on 16 September 2020, on MEDLINE, PsycINFO, EMBASE, CENTRAL, Web of Science, Scopus and clinical trial registries. Meta-analyses were conducted where possible. Results Forty-seven papers from 46 trials of the 5213 identified met inclusion criteria, with all but one of the included trials conducted in North America. Three focused predominantly on AOD, six on juvenile justice, two on homelessness, five on young men who have sex with men (YMSM), 26 on ethnic minorities, two on mental ill-health, three on out-of-home care, however no trials were identified in LGBTQI\, +\,groups outside of YMSM. The 47 included papers had a combined total of 21,543 participants. The vast majority (26/46) of trials were conducted with ethnic minority groups, with most of the interventions delivered as group therapy, and some involving parents and caregivers. Condom use was the most frequently reported outcome measure. In trials targeting ethnic minorities, the meta-analysis found a medium effect size (0.62, p\,=\,0.0004) of the intervention on condom use. Conclusions There remains a dearth of research undertaken outside of North America, and in high-risk groups other than ethnic minorities. Future interventions should address sexual health more broadly than just the absence of negative biological outcomes with LGBTQI+, homeless and mental ill-health populations targeted for such work.},

  abstract = {Opioid use disorder (OUD) is a common, treatable chronic disease that can be effectively managed in primary care settings. Untreated OUD is associated with considerable morbidity and mortality—notably, overdose, infectious complications of injecting drug use, and profoundly diminished quality of life. Withdrawal management and medication tapers are ineffective and are associated with increased rates of relapse and death. Pharmacotherapy is the evidence based mainstay of OUD treatment, and many studies support its integration into primary care settings. Evidence is strongest for the opioid agonists buprenorphine and methadone, which randomized controlled trials have shown to decrease illicit opioid use and mortality. Discontinuation of opioid agonist therapy is associated with increased rates of relapse and mortality. Less evidence is available for the opioid antagonist extended release naltrexone, with a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials showing decreased illicit opioid use but no effect on mortality. Treating OUD in primary care settings is cost effective, improves outcomes for both OUD and other medical comorbidities, and is highly acceptable to patients. Evidence on whether behavioral interventions improve outcomes for patients receiving pharmacotherapy is mixed, with guidelines promoting voluntary engagement in psychosocial supports, including counseling. Further work is needed to promote the integration of OUD treatment into primary care and to overcome regulatory barriers to integrating methadone into primary care treatment in the US.},

  abstract = {Objectives To describe mortality due to opioid toxicity among people who experienced incarceration in Ontario between 2015 and 2020, during the fentanyl-dominant era. Design In this retrospective cohort study, we linked Ontario coronial data on opioid toxicity deaths between 2015 and 2020 with correctional data for adults incarcerated in Ontario provincial correctional facilities. Setting Ontario, Canada. Participants Whole population data. Main outcomes and measures The primary outcome was opioid toxicity death and the exposure was any incarceration in a provincial correctional facility between 2015 and 2020. We calculated crude death rates and age-standardised mortality ratios (SMR). Results Between 2015 and 2020, 8460 people died from opioid toxicity in Ontario. Of those, 2207 (26.1\%) were exposed to incarceration during the study period. Among those exposed to incarceration during the study period (n=1 29 152), 1.7\% died from opioid toxicity during this period. Crude opioid toxicity death rates per 10 000 persons years were 43.6 (95\% CI=41.8 to 45.5) for those exposed to incarceration and 0.95 (95\% CI=0.93 to 0.97) for those not exposed. Compared with those not exposed, the SMR for people exposed to incarceration was 31.2 (95\% CI=29.8 to 32.6), and differed by sex, at 28.1 (95\% CI=26.7 to 29.5) for males and 77.7 (95\% CI=69.6 to 85.9) for females. For those exposed to incarceration who died from opioid toxicity, 10.6\% died within 14 days of release and the risk was highest between days 4 and 7 postrelease, at 288.1 per 10 000 person years (95\% CI=227.8 to 348.1). Conclusions The risk of opioid toxicity death is many times higher for people who experience incarceration compared with others in Ontario. Risk is markedly elevated in the week after release, and women who experience incarceration have a substantially higher SMR than men who experience incarceration. Initiatives to prevent deaths should consider programmes and policies in correctional facilities to address high risk on release.},

  abstract = {Background: Little is known about the engagement of young people who use drugs (PWUD) in harm reduction programs (HRPs), and few studies have included non-opioid users and non-injectors. While HRPs have effectively engaged PWUD, young people are under-represented in their services. Methods: The Injection Drug Users Health Alliance Citywide Study (IDUCS) is the largest community-based study of PWUD in HRPs in the US. From 2014–2015, 2421 HRP participants across New York City (NYC) completed a cross-sectional survey. We investigated differences in socio-demographics, service utilization, and risk behaviors between young (aged 18–30) and older participants and examined factors associated with overdose among young participants. Results: The study included 257 young participants. They were significantly more likely than older participants to be white, educated, uninsured, unstably housed or homeless, and have a history of incarceration and residential drug treatment. They were more likely to report recent overdose but less likely to report knowledge of naloxone. Young participants also had higher rates of alcohol, marijuana, benzodiazepine, and injection drug use, and related risk behaviors such as public injection. Factors associated with past year overdose among young participants included experiencing symptoms of psychological distress (AOR = 9.71), being unstably housed or homeless (AOR = 4.39), and utilizing detox (AOR = 4.20). Conclusions: Young PWUD who access services at HRPs in NYC differ significantly from their older counterparts. New York City and other urban centers that attract young PWUD should consider implementing harm reduction oriented services tailored to the unique needs of young people.},

  abstract = {(1) The harm-reduction benefits of opioid agonist treatment (OAT) are well-established; however, the UK government’s emphasis on “recovery” may be contributing to a high proportion of people leaving treatment and low retention rates. We wanted to develop a rich and nuanced understanding of the factors that might influence the treatment journeys of people who use OAT. (2) We explored factors at each level of the socioecological system and considered the ways these interact to influence treatment journeys in OAT. We carried out semi-structured interviews with people who use OAT (n = 12) and service providers (n = 13) and analysed data using reflexive thematic analysis. (3) We developed three themes representing participant perceptions of treatment journeys in OAT. These were: (1) The System is Broken; (2) Power Struggles; and (3) Filling the Void. (4) Conclusions: The data suggest that prioritisation of treatment retention is important to preserve the harm-reduction benefits of OAT. Stigma is a systemic issue which presents multiple barriers to people who use OAT living fulfilling lives. There is an urgent need to develop targeted interventions to address stigma towards people who use OAT.},

We use modeling informed with linked data from the OAT program in New South Wales (NSW), Australia, to estimate the impact of OAT provision in the community and prisons on mortality and the impact of eliminating excess mortality during OAT initiation/discontinuation. Design Dynamic modeling. Setting and participants A cohort of 49 359 individuals who ever received OAT in NSW from 2001 to 2018. Measurements Receipt of OAT was represented through five stages: (i) first month on OAT, (ii) short (1–9 months) and (iii) longer (9+ months) duration on OAT, (iv) first month following OAT discontinuation and (v) rest of time following OAT discontinuation. Incarceration was represented as four strata: (i) never or not incarcerated in the past year, (ii) currently incarcerated, (iii) released from prison within the past month and (iv) released from prison 1–12 months ago. The model incorporated elevated mortality post-release from prison and OAT impact on reducing mortality and incarceration. Findings Among the cohort, mortality was 0.9 per 100 person-years, OAT coverage and retention remained high ({$>$} 50\%, 1.74 years/episode). During 2001–20, we estimate that OAT provision reduced overdose and other cause mortality among the cohort by 52.8\% [95\% credible interval (CrI) = 49.4–56.9\%] and 26.6\% (95\% CrI =22.1–30.5\%), respectively. We estimate 1.2 deaths averted and 9.7 life-years gained per 100 person-years on OAT. Prison OAT with post-release OAT-linkage accounted for 12.4\% (95\% CrI = 11.5–13.5\%) of all deaths averted by the OAT program, primarily through preventing deaths in the first month post-release. Preventing elevated mortality during OAT initiation and discontinuation could have averted up to 1.4\% (95\% CrI = 0.8–2.0\%) and 3.0\% (95\% CrI = 2.1–5.3\%) of deaths, respectively. Conclusion The community and prison opioid agonist treatment program in New South Wales, Australia appears to have substantially reduced population-level overdose and all-cause mortality in the past 20 years, partially due to high retention.},

  abstract = {Most prisons and jails in the US discontinue medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) upon incarceration and do not initiate MOUD prior to release.To model the association of MOUD access during incarceration and at release with population-level overdose mortality and OUD-related treatment costs in Massachusetts.This economic evaluation used simulation modeling and cost-effectiveness with costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) discounted at 3\% to compare MOUD treatment strategies in a corrections cohort and an open cohort representing individuals with OUD in Massachusetts. Data were analyzed between July 1, 2021, and September 30, 2022.Three strategies were compared: (1) no MOUD provided during incarceration or at release, (2) extended-release (XR) naltrexone offered only at release from incarceration, and (3) all 3 MOUDs (naltrexone, buprenorphine, and methadone) offered at intake.Treatment starts and retention, fatal overdoses, life-years and QALYs, costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs).Among 30\,000 simulated incarcerated individuals with OUD, offering no MOUD was associated with 40\,927 (95\% uncertainty interval [UI], 39 001-42 082) MOUD treatment starts over a 5-year period and 1259 (95\% UI, 1130-1323) overdose deaths after 5 years. Over 5 years, offering XR-naltrexone at release led to 10\,466 (95\% UI, 8515-12 201) additional treatment starts, 40 (95\% UI, 16-50) fewer overdose deaths, and 0.08 (95\% UI, 0.05-0.11) QALYs gained per person, at an incremental cost of \$2723 (95\% UI, \$141-\$5244) per person. In comparison, offering all 3 MOUDs at intake led to 11\,923 (95\% UI, 10 861-12 911) additional treatment starts, compared with offering no MOUD, 83 (95\% UI, 72-91) fewer overdose deaths, and 0.12 (95\% UI, 0.10-0.17) QALYs per person gained, at an incremental cost of \$852 (95\% UI, \$14-\$1703) per person. Thus, XR-naltrexone only was a dominated strategy (both less effective and more costly) and the ICER of all 3 MOUDs compared with no MOUD was \$7252 (95\% UI, \$140-\$10\,018) per QALY. Among everyone with OUD in Massachusetts, XR-naltrexone only averted 95 overdose deaths over 5 years (95\% UI, 85-169)—a 0.9\% decrease in state-level overdose mortality—while the all-MOUD strategy averted 192 overdose deaths (95\% UI, 156-200)—a 1.8\% decrease.The findings of this simulation-modeling economic study suggest that offering any MOUD to incarcerated individuals with OUD would prevent overdose deaths and that offering all 3 MOUDs would prevent more deaths and save money compared with an XR-naltrexone–only strategy.},

In the context of dramatically rising opioid-related harms, it is critical that we understand the drivers of stigma and how it affects opioid use disorder treatment and policy. The aim of this narrative review is to discuss how opioid-related stigma impacts treatment provision and harm reduction, and provide potential strategies to reduce stigma at a social and structural level. We used the Framework for Integrating Normative Influences on Stigma (FINIS) to identify sources of opioid-related stigma at the macro (structural stigma), meso (public stigma) and micro (internalised stigma) levels. Reducing stigma requires strategies that target multiple levels, however addressing inequity in the laws, regulations, and rules that segregate people with opioid and other substance use disorders from mainstream society is essential.},

In the context of dramatically rising opioid-related harms, it is critical that we understand the drivers of stigma and how it affects opioid use disorder treatment and policy. The aim of this narrative review is to discuss how opioid-related stigma impacts treatment provision and harm reduction, and provide potential strategies to reduce stigma at a social and structural level. We used the Framework for Integrating Normative Influences on Stigma (FINIS) to identify sources of opioid-related stigma at the macro (structural stigma), meso (public stigma) and micro (internalised stigma) levels. Reducing stigma requires strategies that target multiple levels, however addressing inequity in the laws, regulations, and rules that segregate people with opioid and other substance use disorders from mainstream society is essential.},

  abstract = {Background: The opioid epidemic is a public health crisis. Medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) include: 1) buprenorphine, 2) methadone, and 3) extended-release naltrexone (XR-NTX). Research should investigate patients' and providers' perspectives of MOUD since they can influence prescription, retention, and recovery. Methods: This systematic review focused on patients' and providers' perceptions of MOUD. The review eligibility criteria included inclusion of the outcome of interest, in English, and involving persons ≥18 years. A PubMed database search yielded 1692 results; we included 152 articles in the final review. Results: There were 63 articles about buprenorphine, 115 articles about methadone, and 16 about naltrexone. Misinformation and stigma associated with MOUD were common patient themes. Providers reported lack of training and resources as barriers to MOUD. Conclusion: This review suggests that patients have significant misinformation regarding MOUD. Due to the severity of the opioid epidemic, research must consider the effects of patients' and providers' perspectives on treatment for OUD, including the effects on the type of MOUD prescribed, patient retention and adherence, and ultimately the number of patients treated for OUD, which will aid in curbing the opioid epidemic. © 2020},

  abstract = {Introduction Long-acting injectable depot buprenorphine is a recent addition to the suite of opioid agonist therapies (OAT) used to treat opioid use disorder (OUD). However, there has been little research that focuses on the lived experience of people receiving depot buprenorphine treatment and reasons for why people decide to discontinue. The aim of this study was to explore what it is like to receive depot buprenorphine and to understand the motivations behind why people discontinue. Methods Open-ended, semi-structured interviews were conducted between November 2021 and January 2022 with individuals who were either currently receiving depot buprenorphine or had discontinued or were in the process of discontinuing depot buprenorphine. Liberati, et~al.’s (2022) adaptation of Dixon-Woods's (2006) candidacy framework was used to analyse the participant experiences. Results 40 participants (26 male, 13 female, 1 undisclosed; mean age 42 years) were interviewed about their experience with depot buprenorphine. At the time of the interview, 21 were currently receiving depot buprenorphine and 19 had discontinued this treatment or were in the process of discontinuing. Participants cited 4 key reasons why they decided to discontinue depot buprenorphine:1) feeling forced into the program, 2) experiencing negative side-effects, 3) finding the treatment ineffective, and 4) wanting to stop depot buprenorphine/OAT to use opioids again or feeling ‘cured’ and no longer in need of OAT. Participants were ultimately discussing issues related to clinician-patient power relations, agency and bodily autonomy, and the pursuit of well-being. Conclusion Depot buprenorphine remains a promising treatment for OUD and offers potential to improve treatment adherence. Instances of restricted OAT choice and consumer concerns regarding a lack of agency must be addressed in order to enhance therapeutic relationships. Clinicians and other healthcare workers in this field also need greater access to information about depot buprenorphine to better address issues patients face during treatment. More research is required to understand patient and treatment choice given the options of these new treatment formulations.},

The aims of this review are to estimate the prevalence of injecting frequency among PWID and compare these estimates to current needle–syringe distribution coverage estimates, and identify socio-demographic and risk characteristics, and harms associated with daily or more injecting. Methods We conducted a systematic review of the peer-reviewed and grey literature from 2008 to 2018 and extracted needle–syringe distribution coverage data from a recent systematic review. We generated country-, region-, and global-level estimates of daily or more injecting. We also ran meta-regression analyses to determine associations between daily or more injecting and socio-demographic characteristics, injecting risk behaviour, non-fatal overdose, injection site skin infection, and blood borne virus prevalence. Results Our search resulted in 61,077 sources, from which 198 studies were eligible for inclusion in this review. There were 74 countries with estimates for injecting frequency. Globally, we estimated that 68.1\% (95\%CI 64.5-71.6\%) of PWID, equating to approximately 10.5 (95\% UI 6.8–15.0) million people, inject daily or more frequently. There was a higher percentage of participants reporting daily or more injecting among samples with shorter injecting careers, more male participants and higher reporting of opioids as their main drug injected. Daily or more injecting was also associated with samples reporting a higher prevalence of HIV and hepatitis C antibody (anti-HCV), non-fatal overdose, and receptive needle sharing in the previous month. Implications WHO recently recommended a needle–syringe distribution target of 300 needles per PWID per year which is unlikely to be sufficient for the majority of PWID injecting daily or more who are out of drug treatment.

Such non-fatal events may also result in overdose-related sequelae, ranging from physical injury to paralysis. Given variation in drug markets and treatment availability across countries and regions, we may see similar variations in non-fatal overdose prevalence. Monitoring non-fatal overdose prevalence among PWID is essential for informing treatment intervention efforts, and thus our review aims to estimate the global, regional, and national prevalence of non-fatal overdose, and determine characteristics associated with experiencing such an event. Methods We conducted a systematic review and meta-analyses to estimate country, regional, and global estimates of recent and lifetime non-fatal overdose prevalence among PWID. Using meta-regression analyses we also determined associations between sample characteristics and non-fatal overdose prevalence. Results An estimated 3.2 (1.8–5.2) million PWID have experienced at least one overdose in the previous year. Among PWID, 20.5\% (15.0–26.1\%) and 41.5\% (34.6–48.4\%) had experienced a non-fatal event in the previous 12 months and lifetime respectively. Frequent injecting was strongly associated with PWID reporting recent and lifetime non-fatal overdose. Estimates of recent non-fatal overdose were particularly high in Asia and North America. Conclusion Around one in five PWID are at an elevated risk of fatally overdosing every year, however there is substantial geographical variation. In countries with higher rates of non-fatal overdose there is need to introduce or mainstream overdose prevention strategies such as opioid agonist treatment and naloxone administration training programs.},

  abstract = {Introduction and Aims To estimate the number of deaths that would have occurred among patients receiving oral naltrexone for opioid use under the Special Access Scheme if these patients had received methadone. Design and Methods We analysed mortality in cohorts treated with oral naltrexone and methadone. Data were from 1097 patients of in WA providing oral naltrexone for opioid use under the SAS,1998–2000, and all participants in WA (n = 2520) and New South Wales (NSW) (n = 11,174) methadone programs over the same period. We calculated mortality rates among patients receiving naltrexone and methadone, and excess mortality among patients receiving naltrexone. Results Oral naltrexone patients had higher mortality than those treated with methadone, even when favourable assumptions were made about the effects of naltrexone on mortality. Total oral naltrexone mortality was significantly greater than for methadone in WA (rate ratio 3.5; 95\% confidence interval 2.2–5.8) and NSW (rate ratio 3.5; 95\% confidence interval 2.4–5.0). Among 1097 oral naltrexone patients we estimate that there were 25–29 deaths over two years that would probably not have occurred if these patients had received methadone. The major reason was higher mortality rate post-treatment cessation. Discussion and Conclusions Large-scale use of oral naltrexone to treat opioid users may not have, as intended, saved lives. Implant naltrexone continues to be prescribed under the SAS in the absence of reliable efficacy and safety data. There is a need to review widespread use of unregistered medications under the SAS, particularly with vulnerable patient groups. [Degenhardt L, Larney S, Kimber J, Farrell M, Hall W.

Design/methodology/approach Data from several years are presented with a focus on data from 2021. In 2021, data were derived from 2,339 questionnaires filled out by DCS users and a total of 2,868 drug checking test results from samples collected at the fixed-site service in Bogotá and 30 music festivals in 8 cities nationwide. Findings The tusi phenomenon is gaining strength in Colombia revealing a problem associated with the changing makeup of tusi and, thus, polydrug use. MDMA adulteration and misrepresentations have increased in comparison to 2019. There is an increasing number of people who want to use the DCS in Colombia, which is encouraging but also exposes the limitations of the drug checking methods available to EC. Originality/value This paper offers the first publication of the pioneering drug checking organization EC in Latin America.},

Best-worst scaling (BWS) is a preference elicitation method from health economics that has never been applied to addiction care broadly, or iOAT specifically. We describe the stages of developing a BWS scale that assesses iOAT clients’ treatment delivery preferences to inform program planning and maximize healthcare efficiency. Methods We underwent several steps to reveal the relevant attributes/levels and design the scale structure. An initial list of potential attributes and levels was established from a literature review and prior qualitative data. Then, we conducted semi-structured interviews and focus groups with clients (n=21) on their iOAT preferences to confirm the attributes and prioritize/include new ones. Next, we conducted semi-structured interviews and focus groups with iOAT experts and stakeholders to receive their input on the draft list of attributes and levels. A BWS profile case design was piloted with iOAT clients (n=18) from different sites during a think aloud interview. After several rounds of revisions, the final version was tested by iOAT clients (n=2) before the scale was launched. Results We developed a person-centered scale that assesses current and former iOAT clients' most and least wanted aspects of iOAT delivery. The final version yielded 7 unique attributes: choice of medication, choice of dose, convenience, location \& space, scheduling \& routines, staff \& training, and types of services offered. Conclusion This scale can help expand iOAT programs in a way that is person-centered, rapid, and affordable. The methodology is a guide for other regions with similar populations who aim to develop strong quantitative methodologies that prioritize client collaboration.},

  abstract = {Objectives Existing health services for young people (YP)(10–24 years), which are predominantly designed for but not with young people, often do not meet YP’s needs. The 2018 Global Consensus Statement on meaningful adolescent and youth engagement affirms that YP have a fundamental right to actively and meaningfully engage in all matters that affect their lives. We present four case studies from three countries in sub-Saharan Africa as practical examples of the engagement of young people as partners in health research. We critically reflect on best practices to inform and guide the increasing adoption of collaborative approaches. Methods We developed a narrative summary of each case study through review of study documentation and discussions with research staff and young people. A youth engagement framework was used to describe partnership activities according to the following dimensions: purpose, process, positioning, perspective, power relations, place and protection. We reflected on innovative practices used, overall level of participation achieved and strategies to address ethical, logistical and/or financial barriers. Results In all case studies, we found evidence of engagement activities that aligned with the Global Consensus Statement on Meaningful Youth Engagement. However, access to participation was often uneven and despite efforts, marginalised young people continue to have insufficient opportunities to engage. Furthermore, although young people had some opportunity to influence the research methods, many of the key design decisions had been determined prior to their involvement. In our case studies, researchers had built in insufficient opportunities to evaluate the level and impact of youth engagement. Conclusions We therefore recommend early involvement of young people in the research process so that they can contribute to setting the research agenda, the design of planned studies and thus increase the scope of their engagement from the beginning. Youth engagement activities need to be evaluated from the perspective of all stakeholders including young people themselves with a focus on opportunities to engage, the level of engagement achieved and impact of engagement. From the beginning, researchers should provide space for learning, and involve young people in encouraging critical reflection of what does not yet work, as well as what does, to enable improvements.},

  abstract = {Aims The aims were to (1) estimate the prevalence of alcohol and drug use disorders in prisoners on reception to prison and (2) estimate and test sources of between study heterogeneity. Methods Studies reporting the 12-month prevalence of alcohol and drug use disorders in prisoners on reception to prison from 1 January 1966 to 11 August 2015 were identified from seven bibliographic indexes. Primary studies involving clinical interviews or validated instruments leading to DSM or ICD diagnoses were included; self-report surveys and investigations that assessed individuals more than 3 months after arrival to prison were not. Random-effects meta-analysis and subgroup and meta-regression analyses were conducted. Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were followed. Results In total, 24 studies with a total of 18 388 prisoners across 10 countries were identified. The random-effects pooled prevalence estimate of alcohol use disorder was 24\% [95\% confidence interval (CI) = 21–27], with very high heterogeneity (I2 = 94\%). These ranged from 16 to 51\% in male and 10–30\% in female prisoners. For drug use disorders, there was evidence of heterogeneity by sex, and the pooled prevalence estimate in male prisoners was 30\% (95\% CI = 22–38; I2 = 98\%; 13 studies; range 10–61\%) and, in female prisoners, was 51\% (95\% CI = 43–58; I2 = 95\%; 10 studies; range 30–69\%). On meta-regression, sources of heterogeneity included higher prevalence of drug use disorders in women, increasing rates of drug use disorders in recent decades, and participation rate. Conclusions Substance use disorders are highly prevalent in prisoners. Approximately a quarter of newly incarcerated prisoners of both sexes had an alcohol use disorder, and the prevalence of a drug use disorder was at least as high in men, and higher in women.},

  abstract = {Background The drug toxicity crisis continues to be a significant cause of death. Over 24,600 people died from opioid toxicity in Canada over the last 5 years. Safe supply programs are required now more than ever to address the high rate of drug toxicity overdose deaths caused by illicit fentanyl and its analogues. This study aims to identify opioid preferences and associated variables to inform further phases of safe supply program implementation. Methods The Harm Reduction Client Survey, an annual cross-sectional survey of people who use drugs (PWUD), was administered at harm reduction supply distribution sites in BC in October–December 2019. The survey collects information on substance use patterns, associated harms, stigma, and utilization of harm reduction services. Eligibility criteria for survey participation included aged 19 years or older; self-reported substance use of any illicit substance in the past six months, and ability to provide verbal informed consent. We conducted multivariate logistic regression to investigate associations with opioid preference. We used the dichotomized preference for either heroin or fentanyl as an outcome variable. Explanatory variables of interest included: geographic region, urbanicity, gender, age category, Indigenous identity, housing, employment, witnessing or experiencing an overdose, using drugs alone, using drugs at an observed consumption site, injection as preferred mode of use, injecting any drug, frequency of use, and drugs used in last 3 days. Results Of the 621 survey participants, 405 reported a preferred opioid; of these 57.8\% preferred heroin, 32.8\% preferred fentanyl and 9.4\% preferred prescription opioids. The proportion of participants who preferred heroin over fentanyl significantly increased with age. The adjusted odds of a participant 50 or older preferring heroin was 6.76 (95\% CI: 2.78–16.41, p-value: {$<$} 0.01) times the odds of an individual 29 or under. The adjusted odds of an Indigenous participant reporting a preference for heroin compared to fentanyl was 1.75 (95\% CI: 1.03–2.98, p-value: 0.04) the odds of a non-Indigenous participant reporting the same. Adjusted odds of heroin preference also differed between geographic regions within British Columbia, Canada. Conclusion Opioid preference differs by age, geographic area, and Indigenous identity. To create effective safe supply programs, we need to engage PWUD about their drugs of choice.},

  abstract = {Background As safer supply programs expand in Canada, stimulant safer supply is often overlooked despite the harms and criminalization faced by people who use stimulants. Methods The 2021 Harm Reduction Client Survey was administered at 17 harm reduction sites around British Columbia, Canada. The survey included a question about what specific substance participants would want to receive as stimulant safer supply. We investigated preference of stimulant safer substance by looking at frequency of stated preference and by using multivariable logistic regression to understand factors associated with the most frequently chosen substance. Results Of 330 participants who reported a stimulant safer supply preference, 58.5\% (n~=~193) chose crystal methamphetamine, 13\% (n~=~43) crack cocaine and 12.4\% (n~=~41) cocaine powder. The options that were available by prescription at the time of data collection were chosen by under 11\% of participants (dextroamphetamine n~=~21, methylphenidate n~=~15). A preference for crystal methamphetamine was associated with being 29 and under compared to 50 and over (AOR: 3.96, 95\% CI: 1.42–11.07, p-value: 0.01); self-identifying as a cis man versus a cis woman (AOR: 1.75, 95\% CI: 1.03–2.97, p-value: 0.04); and using drugs every day (AOR: 15.43, 95\% CI: 3.38–70.51, p-value:~{$<~$}0.01) or a few times a week (AOR: 8.90, 95\% CI: 1.78–44.44, p-value: 0.01) compared to a few times a month. Conclusions Preference of stimulant safer supply is associated with age, gender, and substance use characteristics. Safer supply programs that offer limited substances risk being poorly accessed, resulting in a continued reliance on an unregulated supply. Moreover, programs that do not offer a range of substances can contribute to health inequities.},

Many of these deaths are being attributed to fentanyl and related analogs, which have been increasingly found within street-level stimulant supplies. Within this, people experiencing socio-economic marginalization are at the greatest risk of overdose and other harms from adulterated stimulants. Current treatments for stimulant use disorder have limited effectiveness, and even less applicability to the lived realities of marginalized stimulant users. Emerging technologies, such as drug checking, are being implemented to support safer stimulant use, but the accessibility and utility of these technologies to stimulant users are framed by experiences of vulnerability that render them largely ineffective.},

However, this commentary re-positions that argument as a way of bringing analytic focus to the role of structural forces, like criminalization and the war on drugs, in the treatment decisions of people who use illegal drugs. Specifically, I use my experience as a qualitative sociologist who studies MMT as well as my own experience on MMT to demonstrate how criminalization functions as source of harm in the lives of people who use illegal drugs, that drives them towards the legal, and thus comparatively safer, style of substance use made available by MMT. Moreover, I argue that the dominance of individually-focused theories based on addiction and recovery to understand MMT is related to its punitive organizational structure and lack of popularity among people who use illegal opioids. Ultimately, I argue for a paradigm shift, both in policy and scholarship, that acknowledges the pragmatic value of MMT within the structural context of criminalization.},

  abstract = {Background Shared Decision Making (SDM) as means to the involvement of patients in medical decision making is increasingly demanded by treatment guidelines and legislation. Also, matching of patients’ preferences to treatments has been shown to be effective regarding symptom reduction. Despite promising results for patients with substance use disorders (SUD) no systematic evaluation of the literature has been provided. The aim is therefore to give a systematic overview of the literature of patient preferences and SDM in the treatment of patients with SUD. Methods An electronic literature search of the databases Medline, Embase, Psyndex and Clinical Trials Register was performed. Variations of the search terms substance use disorders, patient preferences and SDM were used. For data synthesis the populations, interventions and outcomes were summarized and described according to the PRISMA statement. Methodological quality of the included articles was assessed with the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool. Results N = 25 trials were included in this review. These were conducted between 1986 and 2014 with altogether n = 8.729 patients. Two studies found that patients with SUD preferred to be actively involved in treatment decisions. Treatment preferences were assessed in n = 18 studies, where the majority of patients preferred outpatient compared with inpatient treatment. Matching patients to preferences resulted in a reduction on substance use (n = 3 studies), but the majority of studies found no significant effect. Interventions for SDM differed across patient populations and optional therapeutic techniques. Discussion Patients with substance use disorders should be involved in medical treatment decisions, as patients with other health conditions. A suitable approach is Shared Decision Making, emphasizing the patients’ preferences. However, due to the heterogeneity of the included studies, results should be interpreted with caution. Further research is needed regarding SDM interventions in patient populations with substance use disorders.},

  abstract = {Over the past two decades the number of people injecting opioids has increased globally, accompanied by a rise in health-related harms, including overdose. This research utilised Australian and international data to address significant gaps in the epidemiology of illicit opioid injection and associated harms. The first three studies drew on data from the Australian Needle Syringe Program Survey (ANSPS), an annual national cross-sectional study conducted in needle syringe programs. The fourth study used data from the International Collaboration of Incident HIV and Hepatitis C in Injecting Cohorts (InC3) which pooled behavioural and biological data from 10 prospective observational cohorts examining HIV and HCV. The aims of the research were to: 1) characterise the practice of fentanyl injection in a large, national sample of people who inject drugs; 2) determine the prevalence and correlates of multiple non-fatal opioid overdose (NFOOD), a significant and potentially modifiable risk factor for fatal overdose; 3) estimate the incidence and predictors of opioid agonist therapy (OAT) discontinuation, an essential but under-scaled health intervention for this population and; 4) examine sex differences in HCV incidence among people who inject drugs and identify factors associated with decreased protective efficacy of OAT. Results have the potential to inform public health policy and practice designed to respond to the harms associated with opioid injection. High-risk sub-populations, such as fentanyl injectors and people with a history of multiple NFOOD, would benefit from targeted interventions. Findings also emphasise the need to optimise the impact of existing interventions to better meet the needs of people who inject drugs, including the expansion of low-threshold OAT programs with flexible dosing and subsidised dispensing fees, and bolstering the efficacy of OAT in females by scaling up targeted interventions such as affordable housing and safer injection training.},

  abstract = {Current and future options for opioid use disorder: a survey assessing real-world opinion of service users on novel therapies including depot formulations of buprenorphine Mark Gilman,1 Li Li,2 Kerrie Hudson,3 Tara Lumley,2 Georgia Myers,2 Camilla Corte,2 Richard Littlewood2  1Discovering Health, Manchester, UK; 2Applied Strategic, London, UK; 3The Well Communities CIC, Lancaster, UK  Purpose: Integrated treatment for opioid use disorder (OUD) includes opioid agonist therapy (OAT) such as methadone and buprenorphine with well-evidenced benefits. Treatment with typical existing oral medications is associated with burdens and limits to successful outcomes (frequent dosing, attendance for collection/consumption, difficulty in achieving optimal dosing, misuse, diversion, accidental exposure, and stigma from the treatment process). Novel medications include injected depot formulations with less frequent administration, providing consistent drug levels after dosing. This survey assesses the opinion of those with OUD treatment services lived experience to inform future medication choices. Patients and methods: A survey of people with experience of OUD pharmacotherapy \&ndash; the treatment system \&ndash; was completed. Participants reviewed statements describing elements of OUD care using 7-point Likert scales to indicate their level of agreement or disagreement. Data were assessed using descriptive analysis. Results: In total, 35 people (16 in treatment; 19 with previous history of treatment) completed the survey. Average drug-use duration, 20 years, commonly included injected opioids. The majority agreed treatment was effective, but not tailored to their individual needs and limited normal day-to-day activities. Opinions on novel depot medications included the following: agreement on its potential to make life easier, reduce stigma, free-up time for preferred activities. Participants did not report concerns over the effectiveness and safety of depot medications, nor about reduced contact with treatment services that could be associated with less frequent dosing. Conclusion: This survey provides a useful initial record of the opinions of people experienced in OUD treatment services on novel depot medications, which may result in important benefits. Care providers and policy makers should continue to work with those with lived experience to understand the specific opportunity provided by such innovation.

  abstract = {Objective Mortality from opioid use disorder (OUD) can be reduced for patients who receive opioid agonist treatment (OAT). In the United States (US), OATs have different requirements including nearly daily visits to a dispensing facility for methadone but weekly to monthly prescriptions for buprenorphine. Our objective was to compare mortality rates for buprenorphine and methadone treatments among a large sample of US patients with OUD. Methods We measured all-cause mortality, overdose mortality, and suicide mortality among US Department of Veterans Affairs patients with a diagnosis of OUD who received OAT from 2010 through 2019. We leveraged substantial and sustained regional variation in prescribing buprenorphine versus methadone as an instrumental variable (IV) and used inverse propensity of treatment weighting to balance relevant covariates across treatment groups. We compared mortality with true two-stage IV using both probit and linear probability models, as well as a reduced form IV model, adjusting for demographics and health status. Results Our cohort consisted of 61,997 patients with OUD who received OAT, of whom 92.7\% were male with a mean age of 47.9 (SD = 14.1) years. Patients were followed for a median of 2 (IQR = 1,4) calendar years. Across regional terciles, mean methadone prescribing was 4.8\%, 19.5\%, and 75.1\% of OAT patients. All models identified significant reductions in all-cause and suicide mortality for buprenorphine relative to methadone. For example, predicted all-cause mortality from the probit model was 169.7 per 10,000 person years (95\% CI, 157.8, 179.6) in the lowest tercile of methadone prescribing compared with 206.1 (95\% CI, 196.0, 216.3) in the highest tercile. No difference was identified for overdose mortality. Conclusion We found significantly lower all-cause mortality and suicide mortality rates for buprenorphine compared with methadone. Our results support the less restrictive prescribing practices for buprenorphine as OAT in the US.},

  abstract = {Background: People who inject drugs (PWID) are disproportionately affected by HIV and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections in most countries. Global data on HIV and HCV testing and treatment coverage among PWID are limited. We conducted a systematic review to evaluate country-level, regional, and global coverage of HIV and HCV testing and treatment among PWID.Methods: We searched bibliographic databases (MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO) and grey literature for studies, published until April-2022, that evaluated the proportion of PWID who received testing or treatment for HIV or HCV. For each country, we estimated the proportion of PWID tested for HIV antibody in the past 12 months (recent), and those ever tested for HCV antibody and HCV-RNA. We also estimated the proportion of PWID with HIV currently receiving antiretroviral therapy, and those with HCV ever receiving HCV antiviral treatment. Regional and global estimates, weighted by PWID population size, were generated where sufficient data were available.Findings: Data of recent HIV antibody testing and ever HCV antibody testing were available for 67 and 49 countries, respectively. Globally, we estimated that 49\% of PWID were recently tested for HIV antibody [uncertainty interval (UI): 43-54\%; range: {$<$}1-86\%], and 47\% had ever tested for HCV antibody (UI: 43-51\%; range: {$<$}1-93\%). HCV RNA testing data were available from three countries. Coverage of HIV antibody and HCV antibody testing was {$>$}75\% in four and 15 countries, respectively. Estimated uptake of current HIV treatment (18 countries) ranged from 3\% to 82\% across countries. Estimated uptake of ever HCV treatment (23 countries) ranged from 2 to 89\% across countries. Uptake of HIV and HCV treatment was {$>$}75\% in two and one countries, respectively.Interpretation: HIV and HCV testing and treatment uptake among PWID was highly variable, and sub-optimal in most countries.

  abstract = {Background Opioid use disorder is a public health concern in Australia. Opioid agonist treatment (OAT) is effective at treating and minimising harm from opioid use disorder, yet is underused in Australia due to client barriers. Although these barriers have been reported, the barriers that are most important to clients is unclear. The aim of this paper was to determine the most important OAT barriers to Australian clients.Methods A cross-sectional, self-completed survey was given to 204 opioid-dependent clients who attended needle and syringe sites in Australia. Participants were given 15 OAT barrier statements, which they answered using a 5-point Likert scale (1= strongly disagree, 2= disagree, 3= neutral, 4= agree and 5= strongly agree). The Likert scale data are presented using the count method and the mean Likert scores (for the whole sample and for subgroups).Results The two methods determined that the four most important barriers to OAT were stigma, lack of support services, no flexibility and enjoy using opioids. Furthermore, those who used prescription opioids (compared with heroin) were female or non-binary (compared with male), were not currently using OAT (compared with current OAT), were younger (compared with older) and had high dependence scores (compared with low dependence scores) were impacted more by certain OAT barriers.Conclusions Policies around improving support services, reducing stigma and increasing flexibility would be beneficial to reduce barriers to OAT in Australia. Second, certain groups were more vulnerable to OAT barriers, emphasising the importance to better tailor opioid treatment programs to these specific populations to increase treatment engagement.},

  abstract = {Background Opioid use disorder is a public health concern in Australia. Opioid agonist treatment (OAT) is effective at treating and minimising harm from opioid use disorder, yet is underused in Australia due to client barriers. Although these barriers have been reported, the barriers that are most important to clients is unclear. The aim of this paper was to determine the most important OAT barriers to Australian clients.Methods A cross-sectional, self-completed survey was given to 204 opioid-dependent clients who attended needle and syringe sites in Australia. Participants were given 15 OAT barrier statements, which they answered using a 5-point Likert scale (1= strongly disagree, 2= disagree, 3= neutral, 4= agree and 5= strongly agree). The Likert scale data are presented using the count method and the mean Likert scores (for the whole sample and for subgroups).Results The two methods determined that the four most important barriers to OAT were stigma, lack of support services, no flexibility and enjoy using opioids. Furthermore, those who used prescription opioids (compared with heroin) were female or non-binary (compared with male), were not currently using OAT (compared with current OAT), were younger (compared with older) and had high dependence scores (compared with low dependence scores) were impacted more by certain OAT barriers.Conclusions Policies around improving support services, reducing stigma and increasing flexibility would be beneficial to reduce barriers to OAT in Australia. Second, certain groups were more vulnerable to OAT barriers, emphasising the importance to better tailor opioid treatment programs to these specific populations to increase treatment engagement.},

  abstract = {Introduction South Africa has seen a sharp increase in treatment admission trends for opioids despite beliefs that rates of opioid use remain low and do not represent a major problem. To advocate for the extension of Opioid Use Disorder (OUD) treatment and harm minimisation services in South Africa, better estimates of the extent of opioid use is needed. This paper responds to this need by describing (i) trends in treatment utilization for opioid-related problems in South Africa and (ii) differences in the profile of patients accessing treatment for different classes of opioids - heroin, ‘nyaope’ and codeine use. Methods Data were collected from 83 specialist treatment centres participating in the South African Community Epidemiology Network on Drug Use between 2012 and 2017. Descriptive analyses were conducted to describe the sociodemographic profile of patients and multiple logistic regression was used to explore socio-demographic and clinical factors associated with admission to treatment for opioid use disorders (OUD) . Results From January 2012 to December 2017, data from 11 2032 treatment episodes were collated. Of these, 20 319 (18.1\%) were from patients admitted for an OUD. Over time, the proportion of overall opioid-related admissions increased significantly from 16.1\% of all admissions in 2012 to 20.0\% in 2017 (p {$<$}0.001). Data also suggests a significant increase in the overall proportion of patients reporting injection drug use, from 1.6\% in 2013 to 3.5\% in 2017 (p {$<$}0.001). Clear differences in employment status, referral sources between classes of opioids were also noted. Conclusion Over the last 5 years, South Africa has seen an increase in the proportion of opioid related disorders (OUD) treatment admissions. Public health interventions, evidence-based harm reduction approaches and improving access to treatment are among the interventions urgently needed to reduce the harms associated with the increased use of opioids in South Africa.},

  abstract = {This paper explores how drug treatment clients exercise agency while finding their ability to act curtailed by the strictures of treatment itself. Drawing on qualitative interviews with 77 male and female drug treatment clients collected in an Australian study of drug treatment and mental health, the experience of methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) and that of commonly prescribed medications for depression (antidepressants) are examined. The ways that clients engage with MMT and antidepressants are detailed, illustrating how both types of treatment can make clients feel dependent, but can also motivate clients to modify their treatment regimens. These modifications are “tactical” responses generated within the constraints of treatment regulations and can also be against clinical recommendations e.g. stopping treatment. Rather than seeing this as “non-compliance”, it is suggested that the negotiation of treatment is an inevitable response of clients trying to adapt to imperfect treatment conditions, who may have understandable anxieties about taking medication. The ways in which treatment providers might better acknowledge the capacities of MMT clients to engage with or modify treatment are discussed, as is the need to acknowledge drug treatment clients’ anxieties about dependency and pharmaceutical drugs.},

  abstract = {Background: In the last decade, the clinician-patient relationship has become more of a partnership. There is growing interest in shared decision-making (SDM) in which the clinician and patient go through all phases of the decision-making process together, share treatment preferences, and reach an agreement on treatment choice. The purpose of this review is to determine the extent, quality, and consistency of the evidence about the effectiveness of SDM. Method: This is a systematic review of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing SDM interventions with non-SDM interventions. Eleven RCTs met the required criteria, and were included in this review. Results: The methodological quality of the studies included in this review was high overall. Five RCTs showed no difference between SDM and control, one RCT showed no short-term effects but showed positive longer-term effects, and five RCTs reported a positive effect of SDM on outcome measures. The two studies included of people with mental healthcare problems reported a positive effect of SDM. Conclusions: Despite the considerable interest in applying SDM clinically, little research regarding its effectiveness has been done to date. It has been argued that SDM is particularly suitable for long-term decisions, especially in the context of a chronic illness, and when the intervention contains more than one session. Our results show that under such circumstances, SDM can be an effective method of reaching a treatment agreement. Evidence for the effectiveness of SDM in the context of other types of decisions, or in general, is still inconclusive. Future studies of SDM should probably focus on long-term decisions.},

  abstract = {Background Canada is experiencing an unprecedented drug toxicity crisis driven by a highly toxic unregulated drug supply contaminated with fentanyl, benzodiazepine, and other drugs. Safer supply pilot programs provide prescribed doses of pharmaceutical alternatives to individuals accessing the unregulated drug supply and have been implemented to prevent overdose and reduce related harms. Given the recent emergence of these pilot programs and the paucity of data on implementation challenges, we sought to document challenges in their initial implementation phase. Methods We obtained organizational progress reports from Health Canada, submitted between 2020 and 2022 by 11 pilot programs located in British Columbia, Ontario, and New Brunswick. We analyzed the data using deductive and inductive approaches via thematic analysis. Analyses were informed by the consolidated framework for implementation research. Results We obtained 45 progress reports from 11 pilot programs. Six centres were based in British Columbia, four in Ontario, and one in New Brunswick. Four overarching themes were identified regarding the challenges faced during the establishment and implementation of pilot programs: i) Organizational features (e.g., physical space constraints, staff shortages); ii) Outer contexts (e.g., limited operational funds and resources, structural inequities to access, public perceptions); iii) Intervention characteristics (e.g., clients’ unmet medication needs); and iv) Implementation process (e.g., pandemic-related challenges, overly medicalized and high-barrier safer supply models). Conclusions Safer supply pilot programs in Canada face multiple inner and outer implementation challenges. Given the potential role of safer supply programs in addressing the drug toxicity crisis in Canada and the possibility of future scale-up, services should be well-supported during their implementation phases. Refining service provision within safer supply programs based on the feedback and experiences of clients and program administrators is warranted, along with efforts to ensure that appropriate medications are available to meet the clients’ needs.},

  abstract = {Over the past 20 years or so, there has been a rise of 2 parallel movements, one toward the explicit use of clinical trial data to guide clinical practice (evidence-based medicine) and the other toward patient empowerment through explicit informed consent, shared decision making, and patient-centered care. Both components have been integrated into models of quality clinical care, but sometimes there are conflicts between evidence- and guideline-driven care and patient-centered care.In most situations, patients value prevention of disease and disability and increased length of life, so patient-centered care and application of evidence-based medicine present no conflict. Despite general preferences for health over disease, however, individuals make trade-offs every day by working in dangerous or stressful jobs, driving too fast, eating too much, smoking, and taking dozens of other risks, large and small. These everyday compromises are also seen in clinical practice. Patients may choose a less expensive medication even if that medication is not quite as effective. They may choose a more limited operation for cancer, explicitly trading off survival for quality of life. They may decline chemotherapy because they feel the adverse effects are not worth the small chance of success.},

All Massachusetts residents aged 18 to 64 years with a first hospitalization for IDU-IE were included; IDU-IE was defined as any hospitalization with a diagnosis of endocarditis and at least 1 claim in the prior 6 months for OUD, drug use, or hepatitis C and with 2-month survival after hospital discharge. Data were analyzed from November 11, 2018, to June 23, 2020.Receipt of MOUD, defined as any treatment with methadone, buprenorphine, or naltrexone, within 3 months after hospital discharge excluding discharge month for IDU-IE.The main outcome was all-cause mortality. The proportion of patients who received MOUD in the 3 months after hospital discharge was calculated. Multivariable Cox proportional hazard regression models were used to examine the association of MOUD receipt with mortality, adjusting for sex, age, medical and psychiatric comorbidities, and homelessness. In the secondary analysis, receipt of MOUD was considered as a monthly time-varying exposure.Of 679 individuals with IDU-IE, 413 (60.8\%) were male, the mean (SD) age was 39.2 (12.1) years, 298 (43.9\%) were aged 18 to 34 years, 419 (72.3) had mental illness, and 209 (30.8) experienced homelessness. A total of 134 individuals (19.7\%) received MOUD in the 3 months before hospitalization and 165 (24.3\%) in the 3 months after hospital discharge. Of those who received MOUD after discharge, 112 (67.9\%) received buprenorphine. The crude mortality rate was 9.2 deaths per 100 person-years. MOUD receipt within 3 months after discharge was not associated with reduced mortality (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.29; 95\% CI, 0.61-2.72); however, MOUD receipt was associated with reduced mortality in the month that MOUD was received (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.30; 95\% CI, 0.10-0.89).In this cohort study, receipt of MOUD was associated with reduced mortality after hospitalization for injection drug use–associated endocarditis only in the month it was received.

Such services therefore should be offered at every opportunity, regardless of an individual’s interest or ability to minimize use of substances.

  abstract = {Background In response to the devastating overdose epidemic across Canada, overdose education and naloxone distribution programs (OEND) targeted at people who use drugs have been scaled-up. The ways in which people who use drugs (PWUD) – who experience social and structural vulnerabilities due to their drug use – enact advice from these health education campaigns remains underexplored. This study examines structural vulnerabilities that constrain PWUD as they attempt to implement OEND program advice. Methods Data were drawn from an ethnographic study of “Satellite Sites”, a program where PWUD are employed by a community health center to operate satellite harm reduction programs within their homes. Data collection included participant observation within the Satellite Sites, complemented by semi-structured interviews and a focus group with Satellite Site workers. Thematic analysis was used to explore impacts of responding to overdose. Results OEND advice includes not injecting alone, carrying naloxone, and calling 911 if overdose occurs. The ability of Satellite Site workers to respond according to public health guidelines is complicated by contextual and structural factors, including a lack of supervised injection services, vulnerability to eviction, and continued criminalization of drug use. Participants described how responding to increasing numbers of overdoses was stressful, with stress compounded by their close relationships with those who were overdosing. These factors were impacting the willingness of Satellite Site workers to continue to supervise drug use. Conclusion OEND programs are essential and effective; however, they are a response to a crisis within a policy and legal environment framed by the criminalization of drug use. Efforts to expand access to complementary interventions, such as supervised injection services, safer supply interventions, and protection against evictions, are necessary to complement OEND programs and address multiple contextual factors within the risk environment for overdose. Additionally, criminalization will continue to impede and constrain the public health response to drug use.},

  abstract = {Background In response to the devastating overdose epidemic across Canada, overdose education and naloxone distribution programs (OEND) targeted at people who use drugs have been scaled-up. The ways in which people who use drugs (PWUD) – who experience social and structural vulnerabilities due to their drug use – enact advice from these health education campaigns remains underexplored. This study examines structural vulnerabilities that constrain PWUD as they attempt to implement OEND program advice. Methods Data were drawn from an ethnographic study of “Satellite Sites”, a program where PWUD are employed by a community health center to operate satellite harm reduction programs within their homes. Data collection included participant observation within the Satellite Sites, complemented by semi-structured interviews and a focus group with Satellite Site workers. Thematic analysis was used to explore impacts of responding to overdose. Results OEND advice includes not injecting alone, carrying naloxone, and calling 911 if overdose occurs. The ability of Satellite Site workers to respond according to public health guidelines is complicated by contextual and structural factors, including a lack of supervised injection services, vulnerability to eviction, and continued criminalization of drug use. Participants described how responding to increasing numbers of overdoses was stressful, with stress compounded by their close relationships with those who were overdosing. These factors were impacting the willingness of Satellite Site workers to continue to supervise drug use. Conclusion OEND programs are essential and effective; however, they are a response to a crisis within a policy and legal environment framed by the criminalization of drug use. Efforts to expand access to complementary interventions, such as supervised injection services, safer supply interventions, and protection against evictions, are necessary to complement OEND programs and address multiple contextual factors within the risk environment for overdose. Additionally, criminalization will continue to impede and constrain the public health response to drug use.},

  abstract = {Background Opioid Agonist Treatment (OAT) programmes are regarded as a gold standard treatment for people living with Opioid Use Disorders (OUDs). However, OAT programmes are often unavailable or poorly implemented in prisons, in spite of the large numbers of people living with OUDs and the high risk of HIV transmission in prison settings. Unusually, this systematic review synthesizes qualitative evidence relating to barriers to, and facilitators of, the implementation of OAT programmes in prisons in high- and low/middle-income countries (LMICs) to provide more nuanced, contextualised understandings of how prison stakeholders perceive and/or experience OAT programmes within different prison settings. Methods We systematically reviewed six electronic databases for studies published between January 2005 and December 2019 involving prison stakeholders: policy-makers, governors, healthcare staff, prison officers, and prisoners. The search identified 8091 studies, of which only 16 incorporated qualitative methods (including qualitative elements of mixed methods) and met our quality criteria. Four of these studies were conducted in LMICs (Kyrgyzstan, Iran (2) and Indonesia). Results Findings were organized under three broad themes: (1) perceived benefits of OAT programmes; (2) barriers to the implementation and development of OAT programmes; and (3) treatment processes. Discussion A lack of a clear understanding of the roles of OAT programmes and doubts regarding their effectiveness for people living with OUDs in prisons are critical barriers to prisoner participation in both high-and LMIC countries. Prison systems, particularly in LMICs, often lack the resources to mitigate problems with implementation. This review highlights an urgent need to develop further qualitative studies into prison OAT programmes, employing varied methods to explore such contexts in greater depth and minimize the impact of harms relating to OUDs in prisons.},

  abstract = {Introduction Evidence suggests that people who inject drugs often begin their drug use and injecting practices in adolescence, yet there are limited data available on the HIV epidemic and the responses for this population. The comprehensive package of interventions for the prevention, treatment and care of HIV infection among people who inject drugs first laid out in 2009 (revised in 2012) by World Health Organization, United Nations Office of Drugs and Crime and Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS, does not consider the unique needs of adolescent and young people. In order to better understand the values and preferences of young people who inject drugs in accessing harm reduction services and support, we undertook a series of community consultations with young people with experience of injecting drugs during adolescence. Methods Community consultations (4–14 persons) were held in 14 countries. Participants were recruited using a combined criterion and maximum variation sampling strategy. Data were analyzed using collaborative qualitative data analysis. Frequency analysis of themes was conducted. Results Nineteen community consultations were organized with a total of 132 participants. All participants had experienced injecting drugs before the age of 18. They had the following age distribution: 18–20 (37\%), 21–25 (48\%) and 26–30 (15\%). Of the participants, 73.5\% were male while 25.7\% were female, with one transgender participant. Barriers to accessing the comprehensive package included: lack of information and knowledge of services, age restrictions on services, belief that services were not needed, fear of law enforcement, fear of stigma, lack of concern, high cost, lack of outreach, lack of knowledge of HCV/TB and lack of youth friendly services. Conclusions The consultations provide a rare insight into the lived experiences of adolescents who inject drugs and highlight the dissonance between their reality and current policy and programmatic approaches. Findings suggest that harm reduction and HIV policies and programmes should adapt the comprehensive package to reach young people and explore linkages to other sectors such as education and employment to ensure they are fully supported and protected. Continued participation of the community of young people who inject drugs can help ensure policy and programmes respond to the social exclusion and denial of rights and prevent HIV infection among adolescents who inject drugs.},

  abstract = {Introduction Current estimates suggest an HIV prevalence of 42\% among people who inject drugs (PWIDs) in Dar es Salaam, while HIV prevalence is estimated to be 8.8\% among the general population in the city. To address the HIV epidemic in this population, the government of Tanzania began establishing HIV prevention, treatment and care services including outreach and medication assisted treatment (MAT) for PWIDs in 2010. We assessed gender inequities in utilization of outreach and MAT services and evaluated differences in HIV risk behaviors between female and male PWIDs. Materials and Methods Routine outreach data between December 2010 to mid-August 2012 and baseline data on clients enrolling in methadone from February 2011 to August 2012 were utilized. Binomial regression was used to estimate adjusted relative risk estimates comparing females to males. Results From December 2010 to August 2012, 8,578 contacts were made to drug users; among them 1,898 were injectors. A total of 453 injectors were eligible and referred to MAT, of which, 443 enrolled in treatment. However, regarding total outreach contacts, outreach to PWID, referral to MAT and enrollment in MAT, 8\% or less of drug users accessing services were women. In contrast, weighted estimations from surveys suggest that 34\% of PWIDs are female, and this approximation is similar to recent population size estimations. Overall, 43\% of traditional outreach workers conducting outreach with drug users were female. Though reporting higher levels of condom usage, female PWID were more likely to report multiple sex partners, anal sex, commercial sex work and struggle under a higher burden of addiction, mental disorders and abuse. Conclusions Services have not been mobilized adequately to address the clear needs of females who inject drugs. A clear and urgent need exists for women-centered strategies that effectively engage female PWID into HIV prevention services.},

  abstract = {Aims: This study examined the social, material and temporal effects of extended-release buprenorphine depot treatment (BUP-XR), among a group of participants commencing BUP-XR in Australia, and considered the situated potentials of these new opioid agonist treatment technologies. Methods: Using a longitudinal qualitative design, 36 participants (25 men, 11 women; mean age 44 years) were interviewed, with 32 followed-up, to generate accounts of BUP-XR experiences. Analysis was informed by sociological approaches which attend to the multiple effects of novel health interventions as they are put to use and made to work, with a focus on tracing change over time. Analysis: The shift from daily to monthly dosing altered how opioid agonist treatment was experienced, reconfigured participants’ relationship to treatment, and affected the temporal patterns of participants’ lives. Extending temporal relations released participants from short-term cycles of living and produced different forms of subjectivity, bringing about both transformation and loss. Monthly dosing, and a sense of normalcy characterized by absenting the routines and felt effects of drugs or treatment medications, potentiated a feeling of stability for many participants. For some, disrupting daily routines precipitated disconnection from treatment and social care relations. The transition from daily to monthly dosing required adaptation and new ways of engaging with treatment and care, with medication acting as a bridge to care without necessarily being the focal point. Conclusions: As BUP-XR treatment gains traction internationally, it will be important to attend to the multiple, and sometimes unexpected, effects this intervention makes in the social and material lives of clients. How choice, social connection, and care can be maintained to help secure BUP-XR’s longer-term impact, and how clients can be supported to adjust to what is felt to be a new normal, will be considerations in future treatment delivery.},

  abstract = {Aims To examine perceptions of extended-release (XR) buprenorphine injections among people who regularly use opioids in Australia. Design Cross-sectional survey prior to implementation. XR-buprenorphine was registered in Australia in November 2018. Setting Sydney, Melbourne and Hobart. Participants A total of 402 people who regularly use opioids interviewed December 2017 to March 2018. Measurements Primary outcome concerned the proportion of participants who believed XR-buprenorphine would be a good treatment option for them, preferred weekly versus monthly injections and perceived advantages/disadvantages of XR-buprenorphine. Independent variables concerned the demographic characteristics and features of current opioid agonist treatment (OAT; medication-type, dose, prescriber/dosing setting, unsupervised doses, out-of-pocket expenses and travel distance). Findings Sixty-eight per cent [95\% confidence interval (CI) = 63–73\%] believed XR-buprenorphine was a good treatment option for them. They were more likely to report being younger [26–35 versus {$>$} 55 years; odds ratio (OR) = 3.16, 95\% CI = 1.12–8.89; P = 0.029], being female (OR = 1.67, 95\% CI = 1.04–2.69; P = 0.034), {$<$} 10 years school education (OR = 1.87, 95\% CI = 1.12–3.12; P = 0.016) and past-month heroin (OR = 1.81, 95\% CI = 1.15–2.85; P = 0.006) and methamphetamine use (OR = 1.90, 95\% CI = 1.20–3.01; P = 0.006). Fifty-four per cent reported no preference for weekly versus monthly injections, 7\% preferred weekly and 39\% preferred monthly. Among OAT recipients (n = 255), believing XR-buprenorphine was a good treatment option was associated with shorter treatment episodes (1–2 versus ≥ 2 years; OR = 3.93, 95\% CI = 1.26–12.22; P = 0.018), fewer unsupervised doses (≤ 8 doses past-month versus no take-aways; OR = 0.50; 95\% CI = 0.27–0.93; P = 0.028) and longer travel distance (≥ 5 versus {$<$} 5 km; OR = 2.10, 95\% CI = 1.20–3.65; P = 0.009). Sixty-nine per cent reported ‘no problems or concerns’ with potential differences in availability, flexibility and location of XR-buprenorphine. Conclusions Among regular opioid users in Australia, perceptions of extended-release buprenorphine as a good treatment option are associated with being female, recent illicit drug use and factors relating to the (in)convenience of current opioid agonist treatment.},

  abstract = {Introduction In early 2020, many services modified their delivery of opioid treatment in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, to limit viral spread and maintain treatment continuity. We describe the changes to treatment and preliminary analysis of the association with patients' substance use and well-being. Methods A pre-post comparison of treatment conditions and patient self-reported outcomes using data extracted from electronic medical records in the 5 months before (December 2019–April 2020) and after (May 2020–September 2020) changes were implemented in three public treatment services in South Eastern Sydney Local Health District. Results Data are available for 429/460 (93\%) patients. Few (21, 5\%) dropped out of treatment. In the ‘post’ period there was significantly more use of depot buprenorphine (12–24\%), access to any take-away doses (TAD; 24–69\%), access to ≥6 TAD per week (7–31\%), pharmacy dosing (24–52\%) and telehealth services. There were significant reductions in average opioid and benzodiazepine use, increases in cannabis use, with limited group changes in social conditions, or quality of life, psychological and physical health. At an individual level, 22\% of patients reported increases in their use of either alcohol, opioids, benzodiazepines or stimulants of ≥4 days in the past 4 weeks. Regression analysis indicates increases in substance use were associated with higher levels of supervised dosing. Discussion and Conclusions These preliminary findings suggest that the modified model of care continued to provide safe and effective treatment, during the pandemic. Notably, there was no association between more TAD and significant increases in substance use. Limitations are discussed and further evaluation is needed.},

  abstract = {Introduction and Aims. A consumer satisfaction survey was conducted among clients receiving methadone or buprenorphine treatment for opioid dependence. The survey aimed to assess client perceptions across a number of treatment domains, including the clinic environment, service provision, clinical relationships, medication and treatment outcomes. Design and Methods. Participants were 432 clients receiving treatment at nine public clinics in New South Wales, Australia. An interviewer-administered questionnaire was utilised, designed by the researchers. Participation was voluntary and anonymous. All participants received \$10 remuneration. Results. Seventy-eight per cent of participants were on methadone treatment. Overall satisfaction with treatment was high (mean: 3.8; very satisfied = 5). Participants were mainly satisfied with service provided by the clinic, although had concerns over the inflexibility associated with the clinic atmosphere, frequency of clinic attendance, dosing hours and lack of takeaway doses. While relationships with prescribers and case managers were rated positively, 16\% and 21\% of participants wanted to see their prescriber and case manager more often, respectively; 53\% reported that they did not have input into their care plan. Regarding the helpfulness of case managers in assisting clients with problems experienced in identified domains of case management (e.g. drug use, physical and mental health, psychosocial supports), the mean rating was 5.2 (excellent = 10). Discussion and Conclusions. While participants reported being mainly satisfied with their treatment, results must be viewed within the context of what a consumer reasonably expects to receive from a service. The concept of ‘expectation’ and ‘relative experience’ is crucial in measuring consumer satisfaction among pharmacotherapy consumers.},

  abstract = {Introduction and Aims. A consumer satisfaction survey was conducted among clients receiving methadone or buprenorphine treatment for opioid dependence. The survey aimed to assess client perceptions across a number of treatment domains, including the clinic environment, service provision, clinical relationships, medication and treatment outcomes. Design and Methods. Participants were 432 clients receiving treatment at nine public clinics in New South Wales, Australia. An interviewer-administered questionnaire was utilised, designed by the researchers. Participation was voluntary and anonymous. All participants received \$10 remuneration. Results. Seventy-eight per cent of participants were on methadone treatment. Overall satisfaction with treatment was high (mean: 3.8; very satisfied = 5). Participants were mainly satisfied with service provided by the clinic, although had concerns over the inflexibility associated with the clinic atmosphere, frequency of clinic attendance, dosing hours and lack of takeaway doses. While relationships with prescribers and case managers were rated positively, 16\% and 21\% of participants wanted to see their prescriber and case manager more often, respectively; 53\% reported that they did not have input into their care plan. Regarding the helpfulness of case managers in assisting clients with problems experienced in identified domains of case management (e.g. drug use, physical and mental health, psychosocial supports), the mean rating was 5.2 (excellent = 10). Discussion and Conclusions. While participants reported being mainly satisfied with their treatment, results must be viewed within the context of what a consumer reasonably expects to receive from a service. The concept of ‘expectation’ and ‘relative experience’ is crucial in measuring consumer satisfaction among pharmacotherapy consumers.},

  abstract = {Introduction This paper examines the experiences of long-term clients of methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) in one area of Dublin in the context of a recent emphasis on rehabilitation and recovery in Irish drug policy. Methods In-depth qualitative interviews were conducted with 25 long-term clients of methadone maintenance treatment (MMT). All participants had first enrolled in methadone treatment at least ten years prior to participating in the research and a majority (n~=~16) had first accessed MMT more than 20 years previously. Results While acknowledging several beneficial aspects of methadone treatment, research participants saw themselves as passive recipients of a clinical regime that offered no opportunity to exercise agency in relation to their ongoing treatment. Rather than perceiving themselves as progressing along a pathway to recovery, the treatment experience was depicted in terms of stasis or confinement. Neither did participants report any progress in attaining the kind of social reintegration that is commonly presented as a key aspect of addiction recovery and which, in the Irish context, is a central plank of drug policy discourse. Discussion The findings highlight a disconnect between policies that ostensibly aim to promote social reintegration and recovery and the experiences of individuals who are long-term clients of MMT. Irish policy aspirations of facilitating opiate-dependent clients to progress along a pathway to recovery are difficult, if not impossible, to realise given the marginal status of addiction services within the health system and the difficulties involved in securing ongoing cooperation from other public service sectors.},

  abstract = {Objectives. To explore the implementation and effectiveness of the British Columbia, Canada, risk mitigation guidelines among people who use drugs, focusing on how experiences with the illicit drug supply shaped motivations to seek prescription alternatives and the subsequent impacts on overdose vulnerability. Methods. From February to July 2021, we conducted qualitative interviews with 40 people who use drugs in British Columbia, Canada, and who accessed prescription opioids or stimulants under the risk mitigation guidelines. Results. COVID-19 disrupted British Columbia’s illicit drug market. Concerns about overdose because of drug supply changes, and deepening socioeconomic marginalization, motivated participants to access no-cost prescription alternatives. Reliable access to prescription alternatives addressed overdose vulnerability by reducing engagement with the illicit drug market while allowing greater agency over drug use. Because prescriptions were primarily intended to manage withdrawal, participants supplemented with illicit drugs to experience enjoyment and manage pain. Conclusions. Providing prescription alternatives to illicit drugs is a critical harm reduction approach that reduces exposure to an increasingly toxic drug supply, yet further optimizations are needed.

Denying young drug users’ access to life-saving drug treatment and other harm reduction services contributes to the risk environment surrounding their use and violates their right to health and well-being as identified in the Convention on the Rights of the Child.

  abstract = {Introduction The opioid epidemic continues to be a public health crisis that has worsened during the COVID-19 pandemic. Medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) are the most effective way to reduce complications from opioid use disorder (OUD), but uptake is limited by both structural and individual factors. To inform strategies addressing individual factors, we evaluated patients' preferences and trade-offs in treatment decisions using conjoint analysis. Method We developed a conjoint analysis survey evaluating patients' preferences for FDA-approved MOUDs. We recruited patients with OUD presenting to initiate treatment. This survey included five attributes: induction, location and route of administration, impact on mortality, side effects, and withdrawal symptoms with cessation.

  abstract = {Introduction The opioid epidemic continues to be a public health crisis that has worsened during the COVID-19 pandemic. Medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) are the most effective way to reduce complications from opioid use disorder (OUD), but uptake is limited by both structural and individual factors. To inform strategies addressing individual factors, we evaluated patients' preferences and trade-offs in treatment decisions using conjoint analysis. Method We developed a conjoint analysis survey evaluating patients' preferences for FDA-approved MOUDs. We recruited patients with OUD presenting to initiate treatment. This survey included five attributes: induction, location and route of administration, impact on mortality, side effects, and withdrawal symptoms with cessation. Participants performed 12 choice sets, each with two hypothetical profiles and a “none” option. We used Hierarchical Bayes to identify relative importance of each attribute and part-worth utility scores of levels, which we compared using chi-squared analysis. We used the STROBE checklist to guide our reporting of this cross-sectional observational study. Results Five-hundred and thirty participants completed the study.

This paper aims to understand patients’ information needs and preferences in relation to buprenorphine depot injections. Design and Methods Semi-structured qualitative interviews were conducted with 36 people using opioids (26 men, 10 women; 24–63 years). Twelve participants were currently prescribed daily oral methadone; 12 were currently prescribed daily oral buprenorphine; and 12 were using heroin and not in treatment. Interviews were transcribed, coded and analysed via Iterative Categorisation. Results Participants asked many questions about depot buprenorphine injections.

Findings Participants discussed implants and depot injections in terms of interacting physical, psychological and social factors: dose stability; OPT administration; stopping treatment; co-presence of an antagonist; breaking rituals and habits; reduced choice and control; feeling normal; information needs; getting on with everyday life; and social interaction. Participants identified both benefits and concerns, and variable needs and preferences, with respect to each delivery system. Conclusions Implants and depot injections are not ‘fixed’ medications that can be administered to people to achieve pre-determined treatment aims. Rather, they are complex ‘assemblages’ with uncertain outcomes. Furthermore, they are themselves part of wider interactive ‘assemblages’. Drug developers and treatment providers need to understand this complexity in order to target long-acting OPT at people most likely to benefit from it, and to reduce any unintended negative consequences.},

  abstract = {Background and aims Not all people experiencing opioid dependence benefit from oral opioid agonist treatment. The aim of this study was to examine perceptions of (supervised) injectable opioid agonist treatment (iOAT) (described as ‘an opioid similar to heroin self-injected at a clinic several times a day’) among people who regularly use opioids and determine how common iOAT eligibility criteria accord with interest in iOAT. Design Cross-sectional survey Setting Sydney, Melbourne and Hobart, Australia Participants A total of 344 people (63\% male) who use opioids regularly and had ever injected opioids, interviewed December 2017–March 2018. The mean age of participants was 41.5 years [standard deviation (SD) = 8.5]. Measurements Primary outcome measures were interest in iOAT, factors associated with interest and the proportion of participants who would be eligible using common criteria from trials and guidelines. We examined willingness to travel for iOAT, medication preferences and perspectives on whom should receive iOAT. Findings Overall, 53\% of participants (n = 182) believed that iOAT would be a good treatment option for them. Participants who believed that iOAT was a good treatment option for them were more likely to be male [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 1.76, 95\% confidence interval (CI) = 1.10–2.82], have used heroin in the past month (aOR = 6.03, 95\% CI = 2.86–12.71), currently regularly inject opioids (aOR = 1.84, 95\% CI = 1.16–2.91) and have met ICD-10 criteria for opioid dependence (aOR = 3.46, 95\% CI = 1.65–7.24). Those interested in iOAT had commenced more treatment episodes (aOR =1.06, 95\% CI = 1.00–1.12). Among those interested in iOAT (n = 182), 26\% (n = 48) met common eligibility criteria for iOAT. Conclusions Interest in injectable opioid agonist treatment does not appear to be universal among people who regularly use opioids. Among study participants who expressed interest in injectable opioid agonist treatment, most did not meet common eligibility criteria.},

  abstract = {Background: People who are street involved such as those experiencing homelessness and drug use face multiple inequities in health and access to health care. Morbidity and mortality are significantly increased among those who are street involved. Incorporation of a harm reduction philosophy in health care has the potential to shift the moral context of health care delivery and enhance access to health care services. However, harm reduction with a primary focus on reducing the harms of drug use fails focus on the harms associated with the context of drug use such as homelessness, violence and poverty. Methods: Ethical analysis of the underlying values of harm reduction and examination of different conceptions of justice are discussed as a basis for action that addresses a broad range of harms associated with drug use. Results: Theories of distributive justice that focus primarily on the distribution of material goods are limited as theoretical frameworks for addressing the root causes of harm associated with drug use. Social justice, reconceptualised and interpreted through a critical lens as described by Iris Marion Young, is presented as a promising alternative ethical framework. Conclusions: A critical reinterpretation of social justice leads to insights that can illuminate structural inequities that contribute to the harms associated with the context of drug use. Such an approach provides promise as means of informing policy that aims to reduce a broad range of harms associated with drug use such as homelessness and poverty.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Within North America and worldwide, drug-related overdoses have increased dramatically over the past decade. COVID-19 escalated the need for a safer supply of illicit substances to reduce overdoses with hopes of replacing substances obtained from the illicit drug market. Drug users1 should be at the centre of program and policy decisions related to the development and implementation of safer supply. Yet, there is little empirical research that conceptualizes effective safer supply from their perspectives. METHOD: Within a community based participatory approach to research, we conducted a concept mapping study to foreground the perspectives of drug users and develop a conceptual model of effective safer supply. Our team was composed of researchers from a local drug user organization, a local harm reduction organization, and academic researchers. The focused prompt developed by the team was: "Safe supply would work well if…" Sixty-three drug users participated in three rounds of focus groups as part of the concept mapping process, involving brainstorming, sorting, rating and naming of themes. RESULTS: The concept mapping process resulted in six clusters of statements: 1) Right dose and right drugs for me; 2) Safe, positive and welcoming spaces; 3) Safer supply and other services are accessible to me; 4) I am treated with respect; 5) I can easily get my safer supply; and 6) Helps me function and improves my quality of life (as defined by me). The statements within each cluster describe key components central to an effective model of safer supply as defined by drug users. CONCLUSION: The results of this study provide insights into key components of effective safer supply to inform planning and evaluation of future safer supply programs informed by drug user perspectives.},

  abstract = {This prospective patient-preference study examined the effectiveness in practice of methadone versus buprenorphine maintenance treatment and the beliefs of subjects regarding these drugs. A total of 361 opiate-dependent individuals (89\% of those eligible, presenting for treatment over 2 years at a drug service in England) received rapid titration then flexible dosing with methadone or buprenorphine; 227 patients chose methadone (63\%) and 134 buprenorphine (37\%). Participants choosing methadone had more severe substance abuse and psychiatric and physical problems but were more likely to remain in treatment. Survival analysis indicated those prescribed methadone were over twice as likely to be retained (hazard ratio for retention was 2.08 and 95\% confidence interval [CI] = 1.49–2.94 for methadone vs. buprenorphine), However, those retained on buprenorphine were more likely to suppress illicit opiate use (odds ratio = 2.136, 95\% CI = 1.509–3.027, p b .001) and achieve detoxification. Buprenorphine may also recruit more individuals to treatment because 28\% of those choosing buprenorphine (10\% of the total sample) stated they would not have accessed treatment with methadone. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

  abstract = {The study investigates patient preferences and beliefs and treatment program factors related to the decision to prescribe either buprenorphine or methadone to opiate-dependent patients. The sample (N = 192) was recruited from 10 addiction treatment services in London. Data were collected by means of a single structured interview conducted with patients commencing a treatment episode at the participating agencies. Data on patient demographics, beliefs, attitudes, and preferences were collected using a structured interview. Data regarding treatment goals and prescribed medication were collected from interviews with clinical staff. Oral methadone had a higher preference rating than buprenorphine. Clinical prescribing practices were influenced by patient preferences (both positive and negative), by prior treatment experiences, and by current treatment goals. Patient preferences and beliefs about opioid agonist medications served as an important influence upon clinical prescribing practices. The odds of being prescribed buprenorphine were three times greater among those patients who reported a preference for buprenorphine. The odds of receiving a prescription for methadone were about twice as great among those for whom methadone was the more preferred medication. Preferences were related to previous treatment experiences with these opioid agonists, and for patients in both groups, personal experience was the most important source of information about the treatment options. Buprenorphine was more likely to be prescribed for short-term detoxification and methadone for maintenance treatment. © 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Aim To explore the factors determining the interest in extended-release buprenorphine (XR-BUP) injections among patients receiving opioid agonist treatment (OAT) in France. Methods 366 patients receiving OAT for opioid use disorder, recruited in 66 French centers, were interviewed from 12/2018 to 05/2019. A structured questionnaire assessed their interest in XR-BUP using a [1−10] Likert scale. ‘More’ vs. ‘less’ interested groups were defined using the median score of interest, and their characteristics were explored using adjusted odds ratios (aORs) and 95 \% confidence interval (95 \%CI). Independent variables were as follows: sociodemographic characteristics, OAT-related features (e.g., type of OAT and prescriber, dosing, or duration of treatment), OAT representations, and personal objectives of treatment. Results The median interest in XR-BUP was 7 (interquartile range: 3–9) out of 10. The participants who were ‘more interested’ (i.e. those scoring ≥7) showed no substantial difference in sociodemographic characteristics, relative to the ‘less interested’ participants. However, they more frequently reported forgetting to take their OAT (OR = 1.81; CI95 \% = 1.06–3.10) or reported experiencing situations where taking their OAT was impractical (aOR = 1.69; CI95 \% = 1.05–2.73). Their treatment objective was more focused on stopping illicit drugs (aOR = 1.67; 95 \%CI = 1.02–2.70), reducing health risks (aOR = 3.57; 95 \%CI = 1.67–7.69) and craving (aOR = 2.38; 95 \%CI = 1.39–4.02) or improving family (aOR = 1.81; 95 \%CI = 1.03–3.13) or professional (aOR = 2.22; 95 \%CI = 1.43–3.85) recovery. Conclusions In France, where the access to OAT is relatively unrestricted, the majority of participants were interested in XR-BUP formulations. Being interested was associated with treatment objectives focused on abstinence and recovery, and with experiencing constraints in taking a daily oral OAT.},

This is particularly the case when assessing the likely impact of innovations. Some people may be wary of innovations because they prefer the service they have previously experienced. Consumer preferences for an existing and a hypothetical new bowel cancer testing programme were measured using a discrete choice experiment questionnaire. The results showed that consumers had a statistically significant preference for the existing service (status quo) when all other factors remained constant. It suggested that consumers make decisions under a ‘veil of experience’. Possible explanations for this result include the endowment effect, status quo bias and loss aversion. Future evaluations of health service innovation should be aware of this tendency to favour the status quo. Copyright © 2000 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) were also included.This systematic review and meta-analysis followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Data on study, participant, and treatment characteristics were extracted; person-years, all-cause mortality, and cause-specific mortality were calculated. Crude mortality rates and rate ratios (RRs) were pooled using random-effects meta-analyses.Overall all-cause and cause-specific mortality both by setting and by participant characteristics. Methadone and buprenorphine OAT were evaluated specifically.Fifteen RCTs including 3852 participants and 36 primary cohort studies including 749 634 participants were analyzed. Among the cohort studies, the rate of all-cause mortality during OAT was more than half of the rate seen during time out of OAT (RR, 0.47; 95\% CI, 0.42-0.53). This association was consistent regardless of patient sex, age, geographic location, HIV status, and hepatitis C virus status and whether drugs were taken through injection. Associations were not different for methadone (RR, 0.47; 95\% CI, 0.41-0.54) vs buprenorphine (RR, 0.34; 95\% CI, 0.26-0.45). There was lower risk of suicide (RR, 0.48; 95\% CI, 0.37-0.61), cancer (RR, 0.72; 95\% CI, 0.54-0.98), drug-related (RR, 0.41; 95\% CI, 0.33-0.52), alcohol-related (RR, 0.59; 95\% CI, 0.49-0.72), and cardiovascular-related (RR, 0.69; 95\% CI, 0.60-0.79) mortality during OAT. In the first 4 weeks of methadone treatment, rates of all-cause mortality and drug-related poisoning were more than double the rates during the remainder of OAT (RR, 2.81; 95\% CI, 1.55-5.09) but not for buprenorphine (RR, 0.58; 95\% CI, 0.18-1.85). All-cause mortality was 6 times higher in the 4 weeks after OAT cessation (RR, 6.01; 95\% CI, 4.32-8.36), remaining double the rate for the remainder of time not receiving OAT (RR, 1.81; 95\% CI, 1.50-2.18). Opioid agonist treatment was associated with a lower risk of mortality during incarceration (RR, 0.06; 95\% CI, 0.01-0.46) and after release from incarceration (RR, 0.09; 95\% CI, 0.02-0.56).This systematic review and meta-analysis found that OAT was associated with lower rates of mortality. However, access to OAT remains limited, and coverage of OAT remains low. Work to improve access globally may have important population-level benefits.}

  abstract = {Methods: We conducted qualitative, semi-structured telephone interviews with forty adults recruited from across the United States through Craigslist advertisements and flyers posted in treatment programs. Eligible participants scored a two or greater on the heroin or opioid pain reliever sections of the Tobacco, Alcohol, Prescription Medications, and Other Substances (TAPS) Tool, indicative of a past-year OUD. Interviews were transcribed, coded, and thematically analyzed. Results: Twenty-four participants (60\%) currently or previously had been prescribed MOUD. Sixteen participants (40\%) expressed general opposition to MOUD, citing concerns that MOUD is purely financial gain for pharmaceutical companies and/or a “band aid” solution replacing one drug with another, rather than a path to abstinence. Some participants expressed personal preference for long-acting injectable (n = 16/40: 40\%) and implantable formulations (n = 12/40: 30\%) over short-acting formulations. About half of the participants were not willing to use injectables (n = 19/40: 48\%) or implantables (n = 22/40: 55\%), preferring short-acting formulations. Mixed evaluations of long- and short-acting MOUD focused on considerations of medication-related beliefs (privacy, concern over an embedded foreign body), the medication-related burden (convenience, provision of structure and support, medication administration, potential side effects), and medication-taking practices (potential for non-prescribed use, control over dosage, and duration of treatment). Conclusions: Though many participants personally prefer short-acting to long-acting MOUD, some were open to including long-acting formulations in the range of options for those with OUD. Participants felt long-acting formulations may reduce medication-related burden and the risk of diversion. Conversely, participants expressed concern about invasive administration and loss of control over their treatment. Results suggest support for expanded access to a variety of formulations of MOUD. The use of shared decision making may also help patients select the formulation best aligned with their experiences, values, and treatment goals.},

  abstract = {Objectives To review the metrics and findings of studies evaluating effects of drug decriminalisation or legal regulation on drug availability, use or related health and social harms globally. Design Systematic review with narrative synthesis. Data sources We searched MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, Web of Science and six additional databases for publications from 1 January 1970 through 4 October 2018. Inclusion criteria Peer-reviewed articles or published abstracts in any language with quantitative data on drug availability, use or related health and social harms collected before and after implementation of de jure drug decriminalisation or legal regulation. Data extraction and synthesis Two independent reviewers screened titles, abstracts and articles for inclusion. Extraction and quality appraisal (modified Downs and Black checklist) were performed by one reviewer and checked by a second, with discrepancies resolved by a third. We coded study-level outcome measures into metric groupings and categorised the estimated direction of association between the legal change and outcomes of interest. Results We screened 4860 titles and 221 full-texts and included 114 articles. Most (n=104, 91.2\%) were from the USA, evaluated cannabis reform (n=109, 95.6\%) and focussed on legal regulation (n=96, 84.2\%). 224 study outcome measures were categorised into 32 metrics, most commonly prevalence (39.5\% of studies), frequency (14.0\%) or perceived harmfulness (10.5\%) of use of the decriminalised or regulated drug; or use of tobacco, alcohol or other drugs (12.3\%). Across all substance use metrics, legal reform was most often not associated with changes in use. Conclusions Studies evaluating drug decriminalisation and legal regulation are concentrated in the USA and on cannabis legalisation. Despite the range of outcomes potentially impacted by drug law reform, extant research is narrowly focussed, with a particular emphasis on the prevalence of use. Metrics in drug law reform evaluations require improved alignment with relevant health and social outcomes.},

Problematic drug use is associated with increasing rates of reoffending and return to custody of individuals. Throughcare provides support to individuals during imprisonment through to post-release, improving both the transition to community and health outcomes post-incarceration. The aim of this study is to evaluate the Connections Programme (CP) that utilises a throughcare approach for release planning of people in prison with a history of problematic drug use. The study protocol is described. Methods and analysis Population-based retrospective cohort study. The study will use record linkage of the Connections dataset with 10 other New South Wales (NSW) population datasets on offending, health service utilisation, opioid substitution therapy, pregnancy, birth and mortality. The study includes all patients who were eligible to participate in the CP between January 2008 and December 2015 stratified by patients who were offered CP and eligible patients who were not offered the programme (non-CP (NCP)). Propensity-score matching will be used to appropriately adjust for the observable differences between CP and NCP. The differences between two groups will be examined using appropriate univariate and multivariate analyses. A generalised estimating equation approach, which can deal with repeat outcomes for individuals will be used to examine recidivism, mortality and other health outcomes, including perinatal and infant outcomes. Survival analysis techniques will be used to examine the effect of the CP by sex and Indigenous status on the ‘time-to’ health-related outcomes after adjusting for potential confounders. Ethics and dissemination Ethical approval was received from the NSW Population and Health Services Research Ethics Committee, the Justice Health and Forensic Mental Health Network Human Research Ethics Committee, the Aboriginal Health and Medical Research Council Ethics Committee, the Corrective Services NSW Ethics Committee and the University of Technology Sydney Human Research Ethics Committee.},

  abstract = {Health policies and programs are increasingly being driven by people from the community to more effectively address their needs. While a large body of evidence supports peer engagement in the context of policy and program development for various populations, little is known about this form of engagement among people who use drugs (PWUD). Therefore, a narrative literature review was undertaken to provide an overview of this topic. Searches of PubMed and Academic Search Premier databases covering 1995–2010 were conducted to identify articles assessing peer engagement in policy and program development. In total, 19 articles were included for review. Our findings indicate that PWUD face many challenges that restrict their ability to engage with public health professionals and policy makers, including the high levels of stigma and discrimination that persist among this population. Although the literature shows that many international organizations are recommending the involvement of PWUD in policy and program development, our findings revealed a lack of published data on the implementation of these efforts. Gaps in the current evidence highlight the need for additional research to explore and document the engagement of PWUD in the areas of policy and program development. Further, efforts to minimize stigmatizing barriers associated with illicit drug use are urgently needed to improve the engagement of PWUD in decision making processes.},

  abstract = {Introduction The international community's commitment to halve by 2015 the HIV transmission among people who inject drugs has not only been largely missed, instead new HIV infections have increased by 30\%. Moreover, drug injection remains one of the drivers of new HIV infections due to punitive responses and lack of harm reduction resourcing. In the midst of this situation, adolescents are a forgotten component of the global response to illegal drugs and their link with HIV infection. The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) present an opportunity to achieve the global objective of ending AIDS among adolescents who use drugs, by addressing the structural vulnerabilities they face be they economic, social, criminal, health-related or environmental. Discussion The implementation of the SDGs presents an opportunity to address the horizontal nature of drug policy and to efficiently address the drugs-adolescents-HIV risk nexus. Adolescent-focused drug policies are linked to goals 1, 3, 4, 10, 16 and 17. Goals 3 and 16 are the most relevant; the targets of the latter link to the criminalization of drug use and punitive policy environments and their impact on adolescents' health and HIV transmission risks. Moreover, it presents an opportunity to include adolescent needs that are missing in the three drug control conventions (1961, 1971 and 1988), and link them with the provisions of the Convention on the Rights of the Child (1989). Finally, the six principles to deliver on sustainable development are also an opportunity to divert adolescents who use drugs away from criminalization and punitive environments in which their vulnerability to HIV is greater. Conclusions Addressing HIV among adolescents who use drugs is an extremely complex policy issue depending on different sets of binding and non-binding commitments, interventions and stakeholders. The complexity requires a horizontal response provided by the SDGs framework, starting with the collection of disaggregated data on this specific subgroup. Ending AIDS among adolescents who use drugs requires the implementation of national drugs and HIV plans based on the multi-sectoral approach and the transformative nature of the SDGs, to provide a comprehensive response to the epidemic among this key affected subgroup.},

  abstract = {Aims Prolonged-release implantable and depot injection formulations of buprenorphine are very recent developments in the treatment of opioid use disorder. Such formulations remove the need for daily dosing and provide patients with sustained concentrations of buprenorphine over a period of weeks or months. We explored opioid users' personal willingness to receive prolonged-release buprenorphine depot injections and factors influencing their interest. Methods The study took place in London during 2018, before depot buprenorphine was licensed for use in Europe. Thirty-six face-to-face, semi-structured qualitative interviews were conducted with people who were: i) using heroin daily and not receiving any treatment for opioid use (n = 12); or ii) prescribed daily oral buprenorphine (n = 12); or iii) prescribed daily oral methadone (n = 12). Participants were asked about their willingness to receive depot buprenorphine and were encouraged to discuss factors that might alter their opinions. Interview data were analysed following the stages of Iterative Categorization. Findings Participants expressed a high level of willingness to receive depot buprenorphine. Their views were influenced both positively and negatively by six key features of depot buprenorphine: i) reduced contact with pharmacies and drug treatment services; ii) impact on illicit drug use and recovery; iii) the perceived effectiveness of depot buprenorphine; iv) the duration and dosage of depot buprenorphine injections; v) clinical administration of the depot buprenorphine injection; and vi) potential for side effects associated with the depot buprenorphine injection. Conclusions Willingness to receive a given medication is complex, individual and changeable. Opioid users seem likely to welcome greater choice and flexibility in respect of opioid agonist medications and appear more likely to accept and adhere to depot buprenorphine if it enables them to reduce their illicit drug use and facilitates their recovery. Research is now needed to assess whether patients' reported willingness to receive depot buprenorphine translates into actual uptake and adherence.},

Such formulations remove the need for daily dosing and provide patients with sustained concentrations of buprenorphine over a period of weeks or months. We explored opioid users' personal willingness to receive prolonged-release buprenorphine depot injections and factors influencing their interest. Methods The study took place in London during 2018, before depot buprenorphine was licensed for use in Europe. Thirty-six face-to-face, semi-structured qualitative interviews were conducted with people who were: i) using heroin daily and not receiving any treatment for opioid use (n = 12); or ii) prescribed daily oral buprenorphine (n = 12); or iii) prescribed daily oral methadone (n = 12). Participants were asked about their willingness to receive depot buprenorphine and were encouraged to discuss factors that might alter their opinions. Interview data were analysed following the stages of Iterative Categorization. Findings Participants expressed a high level of willingness to receive depot buprenorphine. Their views were influenced both positively and negatively by six key features of depot buprenorphine: i) reduced contact with pharmacies and drug treatment services; ii) impact on illicit drug use and recovery; iii) the perceived effectiveness of depot buprenorphine; iv) the duration and dosage of depot buprenorphine injections; v) clinical administration of the depot buprenorphine injection; and vi) potential for side effects associated with the depot buprenorphine injection. Conclusions Willingness to receive a given medication is complex, individual and changeable. Opioid users seem likely to welcome greater choice and flexibility in respect of opioid agonist medications and appear more likely to accept and adhere to depot buprenorphine if it enables them to reduce their illicit drug use and facilitates their recovery. Research is now needed to assess whether patients' reported willingness to receive depot buprenorphine translates into actual uptake and adherence.},

Methods Cross-sectional survey of 402 people with opioid drug use (OUD) in New South Wales (NSW), Victoria (VIC), Tasmania (TAS), Australia; 266 clients (66\%) currently receiving methadone, buprenorphine or buprenorphine-naloxone treatment were asked about dispensing fees, travel costs and OAT-related appointment costs in the past 28 days. A two-part regression model was used to deal with non-normal distributions of costing data (right skew and excess zeros). Results Among clients currently receiving OAT, 87\% paid out-of-pocket costs. Among those who paid out-of-pocket costs (N=194), travel costs accounted for more than half of total costs (52\%), followed by dispensing fees (44\%). The mean monthly total out-of-pocket costs were AU\$135 (SD: AU\$121) for public clinics, AU\$161 (SD: AU\$110) to AU\$214 (SD: AU\$166) for community pharmacies and AU\$355 (SD: AU\$159) for private clinics. Compared to participants in NSW private clinics, those at public clinics paid one third the total out-of-pocket costs (coefficient~=~0.33; 95\%CI~=~0.23-0.48) and those at NSW, TAS, VIC pharmacies paid approximately half the costs (coefficient~=~0.58; 95\%CI~=~0.42-0.79; coefficient~=~0.51; 95\%CI~=~0.36-0.72; coefficient~=~0.47; 95\%CI~=~0.34-0.66, respectively). People in OAT for more than a year paid half the total out-of-pocket costs, compared with those in OAT less than a year (coefficient~=~0.49, 95\%CI~=~0.31-0.77). Conclusions Participants in the current study spent one-eighth of their income on out-of-pocket costs associated with OAT representing a substantial financial burden. Total out-of-pocket costs disproportionately affects those who are newer in treatment and receiving fewer unsupervised doses. Considering and addressing total out-of-pocket costs, especially travel costs and dispensing fees, to clients is critical to prevent cost from being a barrier from receiving effective care.},

  abstract = {Introduction Stigma has corrosive effects on all aspects of care and can undermine individual and population health outcomes. Addiction-related stigma has implications for opiate agonist treatment (OAT) and the people who receive, provide and fund it. It is important to understand how stigma is made in OAT and the political purposes that it serves, in order to change the relations of stigma and avoid the reproduction of stigma in the delivery of new treatment formulations, such as extended release buprenorphine (BUP-XR). Methods Semi-structured qualitative interviews were conducted at two time points with participants in a prospective single-arm, multicentre, open-label trial of monthly BUP-XR. Thirty-six participants (25 men, 11 women) were interviewed, and of these 32 participated in a second interview to explore their experience of transition from other treatment to BUP-XR. Results Participants were highly aware of the of the social and material effects of stigma through the negative stereotypes attached to OAT and those who receive it. Participants narrated examples of how stigma governed as a biopower in the relations and practices of OAT provision at numerous levels: structural (such as in public discourse about OAT and the people who receive it, in media, in perceptions about the decisions of investment in medical technologies); organisational (policies about legitimate access to OAT); interpersonal (with health workers) and individual (self-identities). BUP-XR allowed greater freedom and normalcy for clients. The experience of BUP-XR drew attention to the stigmatising potential of time, place and things associated with other OAT requiring daily (or frequent) dosing, accentuating how stigma comes to be materialised as a relational effect of everyday practices. Conclusions Receiving BUP-XR allowed participants to avoid some of the everyday biopolitical powers of other forms of OAT and to reshape self-identities. The altering of relations between time, place and things associated with other forms of OAT allowed participants to feel as though they “pass as normal” . However, the negative public discourse and stigma of OAT is a potential threat to BUP-XR to realise its potential for individual and population benefits.},

  abstract = {Subsequent to initial opioid detoxification, people with opioid use disorder are typically advised to engage in follow-up treatment to prevent relapse. Medication-assisted treatments (MATs) – i.e., the opioid agonist methadone (MMT) or partial agonist/antagonist, buprenorphine/naltrexone (BUP) – are the maintenance treatment options with the best research support for positive outcomes. A third MAT, injectable extended-release naltrexone (XR-NTX), was approved by the FDA for opioid dependence in 2010 and shows promise. However, relatively few eligible patients choose to initiate one of these MATs following initial detoxification treatment. Consistent with the health belief model, we hypothesized that beliefs about 1) efficacy of each MAT; 2) safety of each MAT; and 3) perceived consistency with being drug-free would predict stated patient preferences for a particular MAT or for no MAT. We also hypothesized that perceived structural barriers (e.g., time, transportation) would decrease the likelihood of stating a preference for a given MAT. To assess these hypotheses, we surveyed 372 people undergoing inpatient opioid detoxification treatment. Results supported hypotheses for all 3 sets of patient beliefs, with the patient group stating that they preferred a particular MAT having significantly more positive beliefs about that MAT relative to other groups (p{$<$}.001). The group that preferred “no MAT” had the most negative beliefs about all MATs. Perceived structural barriers were not related to stated preferences, except that people who preferred BUP were more likely to endorse barriers to MMT than any of the other 3 groups. Notably, a relatively high proportion (32\%) of participants were most interested in XR-NTX despite a lack of prior experience with this medication. These results suggest that efforts to increase MAT enrollment following detoxification might benefit from including patient beliefs as one set of factors to assess and target for change.},

Methods We performed cross-sectional analyses of baseline data from an observational cohort study of PWID attending drug treatment clinics and needle and syringe programs in Australia.

With the intention of better understanding the challenges and issues that LGBTQI+ youth are experiencing, this systematic review explored qualitative studies with a focus on mental health services and the requisite social support service policies and programs for LGBTQI+ youth. Qualitative research systematically examines the expressed thoughts and feelings of the research participants, and through reflective analysis of the themes and links discussed, can provide rich and nuanced understanding. A synthesis of the included studies identified five core themes: (1) Isolation, rejection, phobia, need for support; (2) Marginalization; (3) Depression, self-harm and suicidality; (4) Policy and environment; and (5) Connectedness. Key results suggest that community, school, and family resources to support resilience will optimize LGBTQI+ mental health. This systematic review of qualitative research provides a source of rich information to inform the provision of services and policies that will address the disparity into mental health statistics for the LGBTQI+ population.},

  abstract = {Background Patients and clinicians have begun to recognize the advantages and disadvantages of buprenorphine relative to methadone, but factors that influence choices between these two medications remain unclear. For example, we know little about how patients' preferences and previous experiences influence treatment decisions. Understanding these issues may enhance treatment engagement and retention. Methods Adults with opioid dependence (n=283) were recruited from two integrated health systems to participate in interviews focused on prior experiences with treatment for opioid dependence, knowledge of medication options, preferences for treatment, and experiences with treatment for chronic pain in the context of problems with opioids. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, and coded using Atlas.ti. Results Our analysis revealed seven areas of consideration for opioid agonist treatment decision-making: (1) awareness of treatment options; (2) expectations and goals for duration of treatment and abstinence; (3) prior experience with buprenorphine or methadone; (4) need for accountability and structured support; (5) preference to avoid methadone clinics or associated stigma; (6) fear of continued addiction and perceived difficulty of withdrawal; and (7) pain control. Conclusion The availability of medication options increases the need for clear communication between clinicians and patients, for additional patient education about these medications, and for collaboration and patient influence over choices in treatment decision-making. Our results suggest that access to both methadone and buprenorphine will increase treatment options and patient choice and may enhance treatment adherence and outcomes.},

  abstract = {Introduction Opioid agonist treatment (OAT) clients frequently bear costs associated with their treatment, including dosing fees. This study aimed to explore the financial and social impact of dosing fees upon clients. Methods Cross-sectional survey of people who use opioids regularly (N = 402) between December 2017 and March 2018, conducted in Australia. Dosing fees were calculated and expressed as percentage of income, by OAT type. Consequences and strategies for difficulties making payments were examined as proportions. Results A total of N = 360 participants had ever been in OAT and N = 245 participants currently engaged in OAT reported data on dosing fees, of them 53\% (n = 129) reported paying dosing fees. Compared to clients with high levels of dosing supervision, those with moderate or low levels of supervision were more likely to pay dosing fees. The median 28-day dosing fee was AUD\textbackslash 110 (interquartile range AUD\textbackslash 80); median 28-day income was AUD\textbackslash 1520 (interquartile range AUD\textbackslash 700). For those who paid dosing fees, the fee comprised {$<$}10\% of total monthly income for 70\% of participants; however, 23\% of participants paid fees comprising 10\% to {$<$}20\%, and 7\% of participants paid fees comprising 20\% or more of monthly income. Among those that had ever been in OAT, 72\% experienced difficulties in paying treatment costs; 36\% left treatment earlier than intended and 25\% had been excluded due to payment difficulties. Discussion and Conclusions Negative consequences of treatment costs to clients, particularly dosing fees, are evident. These costs impact treatment access and retention that may negatively impact clients' physical health, mental health and social wellbeing.},

  abstract = {It is common to argue that politicians make selective use of evidence to tacitly reinforce their moral positions, but all stakeholders combine facts and values to produce and use research for policy. The drug policy debate has largely been characterised in terms of an opposition between evidence and politics. Focusing on harm reduction provides useful ground to discuss a further opposition proposed by evidence advocates, that between evidence and morality. Can evidence sway individuals from their existing moral positions, so as to “neutralise” morality? And if not, then should evidence advocates change the way in which they frame their arguments? To address these questions, analysis of N\,=\,27 interviews with stakeholders actively involved in drug policy and harm reduction debates in England, UK and New South Wales, Australia, was conducted. Participants’ accounts suggest that although evidence can help focus discussions away from values and principles, exposure to evidence does not necessarily change deeply held views. Whether stakeholders decide to go with the evidence or not seems contingent on whether they embrace a view of evidence as secular faith; a view that is shaped by experience, politics, training, and role. And yet, morality, values, and emotions underpin all stakeholders’ views, motivating their commitment to drug policy and harm reduction. Evidence advocates might thus benefit from devising strategies to morally and emotionally engage audiences. This paper aims to develop better tools for analysing the role of morality in decision-making. Using tools from disciplines such as moral psychology is relevant to the study of the politics of evidence-based policymaking.},
